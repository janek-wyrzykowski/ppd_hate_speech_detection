 :::::I don't think that statement is correct at all, to be honest.  It's incredibly mushy and confuses a number of different ideas.  Australians get to decide who their head of state is by setting laws that say who the head of state is.  They, like most countries, have so far chosen not to do that.  That is the extent to which democratic self-determination comes into play.  Once we have established that neither the Australian people nor their elected representatives have chosen to clarify the issue, Australians' opinions on the subject of """"who is the head of state under the current constitutional framework"""" are no more valid than anybody else's.  Every individual is, of course, free to regard whomever they like as head of state without interference from other people.  Nobody can force any other person to believe anything.  But Australians don't have any particular right to decide whom Wikipedia regards as the Australian head of state.  This is a well-established feature of Wikipedia which everyone recognizes when it comes to things like ethnic disputes in Eastern Europe: people from a country don't own articles about that country.   In this particular case, the question revolves around how the term """"head of state"""" is to be defined more than anything else, and Australians have no exclusive right to define standard English terms.  The standard definition of a head of state is more or less what the dictionary.com definition says: the person who holds the highest position in a national government.  It says nothing about executive power, or diplomatic representation, or actual power, or anything.  It's just """"the highest position"""".  The idea that a country can have a """"sovereign"""" who is distinct from the """"head of state"""" is alien to the most usual meaning of """"head of state"""" in the English language.   """
2153cbf66b2b7e7c,"""pejorative slang term used to refer to a gay man.  In this context, it has been suggested that the origin of the word dates back to the Spanish word gay homo that likes the penis. Apparently when those charged with faggotry were burned at the stake, accused faggots were thrown into a fire witch sucked real penis such as the faggots, likening them to firewood/fuel. Given that faggot referred to bundles of sticks used as firewood, homosexuals came to be known as """"faggots"""".  Reputable sources, however, have been found to debate over the validity of this particular explanation. 

 This is not true.  The first use of the word in English to refer to a male homosexual dates from 1910-1915, according to my Random House Unabridged, and there are several online sources that corroborate this (for example, , which debunks the Inquisition bit, and  or ).     

 :All of which is useful, but beside the point. Faggot (slang) is where this sort of information should go, even if it were true, and we've covered the topic there already. This is simply redundant here, and this anon has tried to inject this into Fag, Faggot and Faggot (slang). -  

 To Rhobite in response to the following message: 
 Please stop removing information from faggot and faggot (slang). Multiple users have reverted your edits - the burning at the stake etymology is probably false. In addition, please read Wikipedia:Three revert rule - you seem to have violated the rule.   

 I will comply with your request. I would like to remind you, however of Wikipedia's recommendation for resolution of disputes: 

 Use of edit summaries in disputes 
 If a content dispute develops, proper use of edit summaries is critical. Edit summaries should accurately summarize the nature of the edit, especially if it may be controversial; if the edit involves reverting previous changes, it should be marked as a revert in the edit summary. However, edit summaries are not the place to carry on debates or negotiation over the content. Doing this will actually exacerbate the situation, because it naturally encourages the other party to respond in the same manner - in other words, by making an edit and using the edit summary - and what might have been productive dialogue instead becomes an edit war. The proper place to discuss changes to article content is on the talk page. 

 You and I have both fallen into the """"edit war"""" scenario as referenced above.  Although, as you state it, """"the burning at the stake etymology is probably false"""" this does not mean it is absolutely false. As there are many people who subscribe to the burning at the stake scenario as a possible explanation, including it as a possible origin of the word """"faggot"""" should be included for the sake of being thorough.  My edit did state that """"IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED"""" the burning at the stake theory. This is a true statement. I also included that """"REPU 	 LE SOURCES DEBATE"""" as to whether or not the explanation was valid.  This is also a true statement. There is therefore no valid reason I can see to remove my edit. I made no claim that the theory has been proven true. My only intention was to share information. Perhaps you should have reworded my edit if it seemed misleading. I don't feel, however, it merited deletion. 

 It seems that there are those among you who have contributed a great deal to Wikipedia, and for this you should be thanked and your efforts greatly appreciated. I would suggest, however, that adopting an """"alpha male"""" stance in controlling the edits of others is contrary to the spirit of Wikipedia. Wikipedia suggests, rather than deleting the edits of another, improve upon them. It is my understanding that the purpose of this wonderful thing known as Wikipedia is to share knowledge, not censorship.

8e2046371589ffd5,""" 

 The paragraph regarding Libertad Green's """"Hawaiian Hula dance"""" on YouTube  
 should be put back in the article.  Having a YouTube video with over a million views is notable.  Furthermore, having a video which appears on the first page of hits on Google and YouTube when searching for a term not including any of the subject's names or location is even more notable.  How many WikiPedia editors or moderators have thumbnail pictures of themselves and links to their work appear when searching for """"WikiPedia Editors"""" or """"WikiPedia Moderators"""" on Google or YouTube's search engines?  In fact, when I Google """"Harry the Dirty Dog,"""" I get a picture of Betty White!  LOL 

 Also, YouTube videos and Facebooks should not be dismissed out of hand.  Companies and celebrities typically have official Facebooks and YouTube channels, which serve as sources which are as reliable as if they published a separate website to post their videos, photos and updates.  The videos I cited regarding the Brazilian Summer Beauty Pageant have written descriptions as well as in-video subtitles including the names of the judges and participants.  In fact, the only """"proof"""" I've been able to find online that Libertad Green took 4th Place is in the BSB 2011 Part 3 video when the M.C. is seen and heard announcing her title. Videos such as these serve as more convincing evidence and documentation with regard to the veracity of claims about their topics than mere text and pictures on other websites. 

 Seriously, after viewing these videos, do you doubt any of the claims I've made in this article about who participated in what role in the Brazilian Summer Beauty Pageants in 2011 and '12? 

 Do you seriously think I created a CADE Cordoba Facebook in spanish and stuck a stock photo of Libertad Green on it to add to her notoriety?  Is there any serioius doubt that the stock photos I listed are of Libertad Green?  Does the girl in these pictures not look like her?  How do you suppose I discovered the images on these websites?  Did it occur to you that Libertad Green might have retained copies of stock photos taken of her, and that she searched for them with Google's image comparison/search tool?  Or do you really think I just surfed around the Internet looking for pictures of girls that vaguely resemble my wife so I could add them to a fake article about her. 

 As for soapboxing, isn't that what all the biographies on WikiPedia do?  Why mention anyone's accomplishments if it's not to make a point? 

 Also, why dismiss IMDb sources out of hand?  They seem to be the standard in the industry, as well as on WikiPedia.  Virtually all of the work Libertad Green has obtained in the Entertainment industry, including her starring roles, is from CraigsList.org, and the two sources most sought after in CraigsList ads for actors and models are IMDb pages and ModelMayhem pages.  I was recently filmed as a news anchor in a Bulgattie commercial starring and produced by Miguel """"Juwanna Mann"""" A. Nunez; what was his director's first question?  """"Do you have an IMDb page?"""" 

 The """"Sins of Jezebel"""" page on WikiPedia gives Paulette Goddard credit for the title role, but has no """"References,"""" and only one """"External link"""" to (YOU GUESSED IT!) the Internet Movie Database. 

 Then there's the circle jerk logic of not using WikiPedia articles as sources for articles on WikiPedia.  LOL  The articles on WikiPedia must be supported by verifiable, reliable sources 'cause you wouldn't want to grant WikiPedia article status to an unverifiable article, but full-fledged WikiPedia articles 
 aren't themselves reliable sources?!?!?! 

 And some guy identifying himself as """"Harry the Dirty Dog - Woof"""" is going to threaten to block me on WikiPedia??!?!? 

 Your hypocrisy and lack of professionalism is so astonishing, that, at this point, I've lost so much respect for WikiPedia that I'd rather you just deleted the god damn article rather than have Libertad Green's good name tarnished with any association with you morons!

 * Regarding the global view, it has been explained above that our article is based on the scholarly work of Michael Barkun. But he is not a historian. He is a political scientist. The long online article authored by him, which I've began reading, already demonstrates that he's writing on conspiracism, a term which may or may not be a neologism (because it has not yet entered our dictionary). Nevertheless, we now this, that he means by it """"conspiracy theory,"""" not that of a police detective investing the working of the Mafia, but that of someone who subscribes to a conspiracy in spite of all the inadequate evidence available which would justify a logical inference. In the article by whom to which I was directed by the editor herein, however, Barkun does not focus on a specific phenomena which he explicitly labels """"New World Order"""" But I really did not read more that the beginning of his first series. That's partly due to the fact that I have little interest, or patience, for studying the sociology, or politics, of such phenomena. My interests lie in its history. I want to know who said or wrote what and when. Unfortunately, so fare I have not found that in the opening of that article of his in the series. What I find most interesting is the work of Robert Singerman, who is responsible for the Singerman list. This work gives one a great initial source to do precisely that. If or when I find that this article turns into some sort of analysis (supported by referenced scholarship of course) I will not want to participate here. However, if this is truly a mostly historical analysis of the NWO Conspiracy, I might want to stay on board. However, I still am in the clouds in comprehending whether this article is about a singular phenomena (as the name implies), or whether this is meant to be about some sort of collective. In either case, I still find myself inside a long tunnel without any light at the end.    

 * One way out, is if this community permits me to expend subordinate articles; for example, expanding the one on Michael Barkun; or developing the """"stub"""" on Pat Robertson's book on the New World Order. I ask permission, so to speak, because my writing may turn into what may appear to be a POV Fork. That is not permitted by Wikipedia. So I ask, what if the subordinate articles are inconsistent with this article, will some editor complain of point-of-view forking?   """

 Obit means 'dies. 
 anus means anus (colloquially 'asshole') 
 abit means 'goes away' 
 onus means 'burden' 

 My translation is correct. 

 Schopenhauer pushed an old woman down a flight of stairs (she was making a noise outside his room). She sued him, and he had to pay her compensation - weekly, for the rest of her life. 

 When she died, he said, in Latin: """"The asshole dies, the burden goes.""""

 -Who the fuck is the US goverment and state governments to take on the role of God and decide who dies and who lives? by God's sake this is not babylon or some ancient culture and the meaning of civilization has evolved for over 5000 years to come to the conclusion that killing a human being is not the best way to solve a crime,,,, 

 - Eventhought more than 200 inmates have been exonerated since the introduction of DNA testings, still prosecutors refuse to acknowledge the fuck up they made,,, and the states will only give the guy exonerated a bus ticket and $100 to start a new life,, like the state of florida does??? big damn deal they get after those years spend unjustly in prison. 

 -Just some personal view: If someday I become governor, I would personally order DNA tests an all the inmates on death row or on lenghty prison sentences on my state, even if some of that money has to come out from my own pocket... if the states can spend 1000 bucks on a hammer ,, might as well spend some of that money bringing justice to some potential innocent people... and If I was governor, I would apply some ancient justice like punishing the prosecutors and police who wrongfully prosecuted the person,, with one lash for each month that person spent in prison to feel how it is like to have the burden of a crime not committed in the first place..and I would do that on public view to let my state know that no PROSECUTOR has immunity when prosecuting a person

5eeff02bba602b8b,"== DOCTRINE OF TPM == 

 CAN CPM PASTORS AND APOSTLES MARRY ??? 

 Firstly the founder Pastor Paul was a married man and 
 had children when in a faithhome. The celibate type of 
 ministry was introduced by Pastor Alvin, a sinhalese, 
 whose ancestors were Catholics. He changed 
 Paul’s vision into a catholic style ministry. Finally 
 this Alvin fell in adultery in France Faithome and was excommunicated 
 from CPM. 

 Secondly, Pastor Freddy Paul, son of the founder (Paul) had got many Pastors married. A leading example is Pastor 
 Manohar who is now in Jaipur faithhome. He has four 
 children. His wife is Sis. Lilykutty. Similarly the 
 founder Paul also got 10 Pastors married and they 
 lived in a marriage when in CPM ministry. The CPM 
 Pastors suppress these facts from the believers. 

 Thirdly, 1 Cor 9 vs 5 states that the apostles had the 
 authority to be married and that was why Pastors like 
 Manohar, Founder Paul, Pastor Joseph (Composer Sis. 
 Glory’s dad), Mother Arthur etc., were all in marriage 
 during their ministry. Celibacy was promoted to create 
 an identity for TPM and thereby preserve their 
 believers from leaving the denomination. 

 Fourthly, Moses who was a married man also was able 
 to see God face to face. All our dedication are as filthy rags before the Most Holy God. Hence let us brag about Christ and not about the TPM dedication. God can use a donkey for his ministry. Num 22:28. God wants someone who obeys Him and not our man-made dedication. 

 Fifthly, Pas. Raman Kutty Paul never had a vision of 
 buying lands and buildings for the church or in the name of a Trust. Their vision was to live in rented places and that was why they called it a faithhome. But now the same name is 
 used absolutely meaninglessly as people do not know 
 the earlier committment. 

 But now all rationalisations are provided but they do not want to part with the name “faithhome”. 

 I wish you are enlightened with the above and not fall a trap to the TPM’s self glorification of their consecration.  

 I encourage you to minister as you are a priest as per 1 Peter 2:5,9. There is only one High Priest who is Jesus. The 12 tribes of Israel had a calling to be a kingdom of priests as per Ex 19:6.  

 CPM Pastors will brag about their melchizedek consecration in their songs and sermons and will not reveal that you are a priest."

 Why feel the need to revert my edit? there is nothing wrong with using the term aircraft. You will find in allot of countries including the United Kingdom that the word airliner is hardly ever used. Many people are not familiar with the term.

 :*Look here, the onus is on you to prove that there is indeed a need to change the name, and most certainly not on me when the previous version was working just fine until you came along. Also, as I've given my explanation in the edit summary whilst reverting you, Airliners is a very specific descriptive term whereas Aircraft is a generic term. If you disagree, raise a consensus building dialogue. Thoughts?    
 ::*Listen, before i start, there is no need to take that attitude at all. I havent spoke to your scarasticaly so why do you feel the need?

This is why i feel the need to use it here. Something to look at, the article in question uses the word aircraft 34 times and the word airliner is used twice.     

 :::*Don't play the victim with me here, this edit of yours on my talk page is hardly confidence inspiring when you say that you haven't been sarcastic to me in the first place. Secondly, I reverted you the first time round on the basis of WP:AGF and that is being said and done without any prejudice towards you but what about the explanation you gave in the revert edit summary to me the first time round? Seems to everybody here it is a tit-for-tat thing that you're doing, eh? Lastly, go click and read on Airliner and Aircraft, the reason why the former was chosen for that section is pretty much self-explanatory. Lastly, keep all your discussion here and stay off my talk page, you are not welcome because you have no respect for others when you don't read their notes first before you post there. Adieu~!    

 ::::As a sanity check, this is an article about an airline, airliner seems more appropriate.  I find the push to substitute the generic term aircraft bizarre.  Why?

 ::::::*What a wrote on your talk page i stick by. I put that there to ask why i was  being ignored. I had a genuine question, you deleted it and never got back. As for the reason for the edit i didn't intend to cause offence. The reason you give was  """"Not Necessary edit"""" so my thinking was if it wasn't necessary surely its not necessary to revert? maybe we just both have different ideas of the definition of necessary?

You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here. 
 *Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase.

 == Wizard of Oz == 

 You may have noticed they reverted your changes. The reason is that it's unsourced, so it appears to be original research. And besides which, the following counterarguments can be made: 

 # Dorothy runs away from home, taking her dog, Toto, with her, so that Miss Glutch will not be able to return and take him to the sheriff to be destroyed. At some point in the movie, Dorothy's reason for running away from home is subtly re-characterized as evidencing Dorothy's wish to pursue her heart's content. - She had already been persuaded, by Prof. Marvel, to go back home. The tornado put a crimp in those plans. The film's wrap-up comes full circle with the song """"Over the Rainbow"""", as she discovers that she's already there in some sense. 
 # After Dorothy is in Oz, and is following the Yellow Brick Road on her journey to see the wizard, she comes to a fork in the road where the Yellow Brick Road continues in three different directions. After interacting with the scarecrow, she and the scarecrow head off in one of the three directions, but it is never explained how or why they made that choice or where the other potential routes would have led. - One can infer that all the yellow brick roads lead to Oz. 
 # Dorothy and the wizard attempt to leave Oz in the wizard's balloon, but Toto goes after a dog in the crowd and jumps out of the balloon's gondola. Dorothy goes after him, and the wizard leaves without them. As it turns out, Dorothy still had the oil can with her, which would have left the tin man without any way to remedy his chronic rusting problem. - They're in a city, so locating some more oil should not be a problem.   
 # The fate of Miss Gultch is never explained; thus viewers do not know whether Toto was safe or not. - True, although it's inferred that she was swept up by the tornado.

 The fact that chiropractors are the ones who have always objected makes the need for inclusion of such wording quite necessary. We can't leave it hanging for readers to just guess. The sources (and history) also make this clear. Other professions, like Physical Therapists and MDs, have recognized the danger and made patient consent mandatory. Only chiropractors have been in denial. (Why we still refuse to include the largest studies, such as Di Fabio's, which clearly show the great preponderance of chiropractic involvement in injuries and deaths, is beyond me. Regardless of that fact, I, as a PT, have always urged caution by all professions, and I stopped using cervical manipulation entirely, since other methods are more effective, safer, and longer lasting.) 

 As far as Herzog goes, I'm not sure that he's a """"proponent"""", but he was hired to defend the profession from lawsuits filed by patients and their surviving families. Until he and his lab were figuratively and literally """"bought"""" by the Canadian chiropractic profession, he did objective work. Then he started doing agenda-driven (pseudoscience) work for them and their lawyers. I communicated with him before his involvement, and later was saddened to see such a change of a fine researcher when this happened. Doing biomechanical studies on a cadaver for this purpose, especially when actual, incontrovertible, cases with living and formerly living (until their """"adjustment"""" killed them) patients showed that it is definitely possible to cause strokes in living people?? No, the opposition to admitting any possibility of actual causation is pretty much exclusively limited to chiropractors for obvious reasons. Their stance is exactly the same type of stance originally adopted by the tobacco industry, and for the same reasons: """"Deny, deny, deny. Never admit."""" Any non-chiros who might doubt the causal connection are the exception which proves the rule. Whatever the case, our sources mention chiropractors, and we should mention them. A straight quote should do the job.    """

 In any case, the direct personal attack aside, there is no big deal there anyway - as my last edit shows. The way it was written with Claudius 25 made it seem like it referred to Claudius. But now, I just added three other scholars who say the same thing about the Orosius way. The real point is that for everything in that section stated by Slingerland there is """"a line of scholars"""" waiting to say otherwise. Slingerland is a minority view on these issues - every way you look at it.  

 That was why I asked the question """"Is Slingerland a minority view?"""" and requested a yes/no answer. All it would have taken was a """"no"""" answer with sources. But the """"no answer"""" never arrived. The situation is obvious, as the references I have recently added clearly show: Slingerland is singing a lonely tune. 

 The main issue was this: When the dates section (with 3 subsections) first showed up and I saw it, I noticed two things: 

 :* It quoted mostly one author in the entire 3 subsections. It may have had a couple of minor other refs, but it was mostly references by one author: Slingerland. And I knew he is not the only game in town. 

 :* And I could also see that the dates suggested were way off (I mean way off) because I had seen the dates the majority of scholars use. 

 The current references added clearly show that Slingerland is by and large a lonely voice (Doktor spin said elsewhere that Slingerland has the temerity to go against the scholarly  trend, or something like that) but temerity does not a majority view make. 

 The date section still relies far too heavily on the minority views of Slingerland and needs many more fixes.   """

 *The photographic reflections of The Unicorn from the petroglyph appear to have been scribed by a process called photo lithography.  The image reflection appears as a hologram, the result of scribed 3-dimensional stone surfaces with precision and calculated patterns of cuts, contusions and perturbations.  The technology to inscribe this artifact is quite advanced and appears to be beyond current capabilities.

Since the NCC fellas are taking on the positives, I decide to take on the negatives.

 *http://www.ccsindia.org/gdas/reviews_india_unbound.htm - NEW YORK TIMES, MARCH 25 ... In one of the more eloquent expressions of this sentiment, he tells of a meeting at which the industrialist Rahul Bajaj is threatened with imprisonment for producing more scooters than permitted by his quota.

 *http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2005031700120800.htm&date;=2005/03/17/&prd;=bl& The emphasis on the state occupying the `commanding heights' of the economy in the Second Plan reflected Nehru's fascination for the great economic strides that the Soviet Union had made under planning. Nehru, it seems from my own interaction in late 1964 with Dr B. B. Mishra, the author of the famous book on the Indian middle-classes, was influenced in this regard by the communications that he had received from M. N. Roy, who was then in the Soviet Union and was reportedly in close contact with Lenin and Trotsky. 

 *http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1526/15261180.htm Non-alignment became viable only because of Nehru's distrust of free-market capitalism, a certain commitment to equality, an admiration for state planning, and, globally, the existence of the Soviet Union as a countervailing force to the Western bloc. 

 *http://www.forbes.com/columnists/free_forbes/2004/0621/041.html Under the socialist regime of Jawaharlal Nehru and his family successors the state was intolerant, restrictive and grotesquely bureaucratic. That has largely changed (though much bureaucracy remains), and the natural tolerance of the Hindu mind-set has replaced quasi-Marxist rigidity.

 *http://www.econ.yale.edu/seminars/NEUDC03/shahe.pdf - After decades of lackluster performance under the all pervasive interventionist policy regime espoused after independence (the so-called ‘License Raj’), India embarked on a major economic liberalization program in 1991, triggered by a severe balance of payments crisis. 

 *http://www.cid.harvard.edu/hiid/662.pdf - The pre-independence experience was combined with a very clear inspiration from the experience of the socialist countries, in particular the Soviet Union, which was reflected in the speeches of the Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and in the now famous Mahalonobis model which had many similarities to the work of Feldman for the first Soviet Five year plan (see Domar (1957))11. 

 *http://www.ndu.edu/library/n4/n035604L.pdf - Remnants of Nehru’s command economy haunt virtually every aspect of India’s reform program. Even after twelve years of progress, more than 40% of the country’s capital base remains in government hands.10 

 * Excerpts from Britannica - 
 : From the sub section titled """"political apprenticeship"""" under Jawaharlal Nehru 
 : Though vaguely inclined toward Socialism, Nehru's radicalism had set in no definite mold. The watershed in his political and economic thinking was his tour of Europe and the Soviet Union during 1926–27. Nehru's real interest in Marxism and his Socialist pattern of thought stem from that tour, even though it did not appreciably increase his knowledge of Communist theory and practice."

 The word """"soul"""" did not exist in the times of jesus, socrates or aristotle, and so the quotations, interpretations and translations into the word """"soul"""" from these sources, means that the word should be handled very carefully. One might go as far as saying that since the word """"soul"""", in the sense we use it today, did not exist in hebrew or arameic, and only partly in greek, that the word should not exist in the bible.

 ==Explanation== 

 Okay... about a month ago, I received a death threat. Nothing serious, just a random cretin shouting """"You reverted my edit, I'll kill you, faggot!"""" with bad spelling. Nothing I haven't seen before. I deleted it and went back to removing more vandalism. A few days later, same thing. And again twice more. That's when I noticed something odd. None of the addresses were real. They were all just random strings of characters and they were all different from each other. I've seen it before, I know you can fake an e-mail address. An old friend once e-mailed me from """"jameskirk@federationhq.co.milkyway."""" I've had spam mail from my own address. But I thought it was rather odd that someone was doing it just to send me crap like that when I didn't even know what I did or who it was. Then things got more complex. They started to say things that sounded very fishy and, after the third e-mail like that, I figured it out why I was suspicious. Somehow, they were finding out personal information about me. Forum posts from months ago, little snippets of my life. That's when I started responding. After a few days, I started to worry about how much they knew about me. Then they started to quote some things that even I had forgotten about and promised me that they knew more about me, including where I lived. They gave me a choice: retire from Wikipedia or they'd find me and kill my family. 

 I wasn't willing to take that chance so I retired... 

 That's why I retired. No more. Here and now, I'm stopping this. I know you're reading this, whoever you are, so I'm telling you, in public, to fuck off. I can't believe someone would be pathetic enough go to this length of shit to protect their right to vandalise a fucking encyclopaedia! All of your e-mails were deleted after their arrival. However, the next one you send me won't be. If you ever contact me again, I'll call in every one of the numerous favours I am owed. Fake e-mail address or not, I will track you down. And when I do, you're going to have a nice little chat with the police. If you ever come near me or my friends and family, I'll fucking disembowel you and hang you from a tree. I do not have to put up with this shit, so I won't. If you out me, I'll find you. If you threaten me, I'll find you. If you come near me or someone I love, I'll kill you. Are we clear? If I ever see you again... You failed. I will not retire because someone demands it. I will return later tonight. Anyone else who wants to fuck with me, this was your only warning as well.

 |== Are we under attack by theists? == 

 My adits with Einsteinian model (of tired light) are gone. They lasted just a few minutes.  

 There is an interesting trend in gravity physics: articles that make no sense from point of view of physics may be and are published all over the palce. Once you show with legitimate math that matter can't be created out of nothing, even in gravitation, then your article becomes uninteresting to the public (as contradicting the Big Bang) and nobody prints it """"just to save vauluable space in a scientific journal"""".  

 After 20+ years I'm beginning to be suspicious whether we aren't controlled by theists dreaming about the return of Dark Ages.  

 Otherwise why for 20+ years, despite that referees can't find a single error in my 6 page paper, it can't be printed? Actually it turns out to be """"not interesting to readers"""" despite explaining, with Einstein's theory, things like conservation of energy in gravitation, Hubble redshift = c/(4.3 Gpc) (as observed), illusion of accelerating expansion of space (observed as predicted), """"anomalous"""" acceleration of Pioneers (observed as predicted), even Arp's local quasars (possibly observed as predicted, but it is for Arp to tell).  

 We are supposed to be nice to theist and not making them feeling bad. Shouldn't they be nice also to us and let us to continue with our science, where violation of conservation of energy is not allowed. Not alowed at least until someone demostrates beyond any reasonable doubt with some legitimate experiment that it is possible and not by supressing any idea that does not fit the creation of matter from nothing?   

 :Please don't attack the motives of other editors. You added a section discussing your ideas, which were rejected by peer reviewed journals. Thees journals may be correct or incorrect in doing so, but under the policies of Wikipedia, such edits have no place on Wikipedia either. Either try to change the policies or try to get your article published in a peer reviewed scientific journal, but don't edit articles with sections you know will be removed anyway, just to follow that removal with an attack on the motives of other editors. This is disurption of Wikipedia to make a point and will not be tolerated.   

 ::Hi Fram, You're not quite correct. (i) These aren't my ideas but only the conclusions of Einstein's general relativity. I just wanted to present them to the public guessing that the public might be interested. For this purpose, using Einstein's theory, I calculated in 1985 the amount of tired light in a stationary space which just turned out to be the same as observed. (ii) The results were not rejected but were not printed as not interesting to the readers (referees didn't report any error in my calculations — if there were the referees would gladly reported it). According to the editors of scientific journals the readers aren't interested in a fact that Einstein's theory explains tired light effect with the principle of conservation of energy. According to them the readers prefer to think that there is no such an effect as tired light and so the expanding universe hypothesis may be treated as the only possible solution. 

 ::For your information: I don't have any theory of my own, and right now I'm doing my PhD work on Einstein's theory. The referees of my paper agreed that my paper contained no new physics and that's why it didn't fit a scientific journal. I don't know why public is not interested that we have to have a tired light effect in a stationary space so I proposed a hypothesis (a title of this section) because this hypothesis explains why the tired light isn't explained by now, while old physics is enough to explain it (old Einstein's theory will do).

This ignores that the common thread of national/ethnic experience is the reason for the template in the first place, and is the thing that ties these together. 

 My own view is that there are too many football teams on Template:Catalan-speaking world.

 I would agree with  about not being sure that the sources given mention the subject; I would go further and suggest the sources need examination and verification here. As a priority, I would suggest that someone with JSTOR access examine the reference used for asserting that Patrick was the son of John O'Neill and a Madame de Buixin which is sourced to an article by Micheline Walsh, """"The Will of John O'Neill, Third Earl of Tyrone""""; the article would of course be a reliable source, but we need to confirm that the details ascribed to this article are actually there. The Walsh article is available  here on JSTOR.  However there are other problems with the article  particularly with chronology that I can see: the article asserts that Patrick, born in 1622 and per the article, is the younger brother of Don Hugo Eugenio O'Neill. According to sources found for the article for Patrick's father, in particular  an article by Tomás Ó Fiaich (writing in his capacity as Professor of History at Maynooth rather than any clerical capacity), Don Hugo Eugenio was not born until after O'Neill seniors' 1630 trip to Madrid. While the article's assertion that """"he maintained a lengthy affair with a Countess of the O'Donnell family"""" is true in the sense that Hugo's mother was Isabel O'Donnell and O'Neill senior and Isabel O'Donnell never married  and they were together long enough to produce Hugo and a sister Catalina,  all this happened during the 1630s  - not the 1620s  - and in Madrid, not in Brussels.  Another chronology problem raised by the O Fiaich  article is that it raises the prospect of a political marriage in 1627 between O'Neill senior and another O'Donnell, Mary Stuart O'Donnell. This marriage didn't happen, but we still have a problem; if O'Neill was married to Madame de Buixin in 1620 or 1621, what happened to her that left him free to marry in 1627 and yet have to make provisions for Madame de Buixin in his will in the late 1630s? · """

6ea019d3d7dc97e2,"== History of leg shaving and the origin in western culture == 

 This Wikipedia page does omit how shaving is not only a sexual role, but it is also a societal norm. Women are expected to be these hairless beings, and perhaps this lack of hair is what further solidifies the dichotomy between the female and male gender. The page talks about how leg shaving became more prevalent after World War I, but what were societal norms for woman and leg shaving prior to that time period? Were women still expected to maintain cleanly shaven legs, or was leg shaving something constructed by the razor industry due to decline in sales because of soldiers overseas. Before World War I virtually no women shaved their legs, however by 1964 nearly 98% of women started to do so.  Although the Wikipedia page alludes to the rise in leg shaving after WW1, however it does not mention what exactly prompted women to join this bandwagon of leg shaving and if this societal norm stemmed from a capitalist movement. What happened between that short time frame that caused that much of an increase in women that decided to shave their legs? Someone else mentioned in the talk post that shaving, like makeup is something that is expected of women I do think that the article has omitted many feminist movements that involve not shaving their legs, even in the talk page there is no discussion of this.  This Wikipedia article should omit the women and men headings since it further solidifies the dichotomy between sex, but should instead include headings that focus on the chronological evolution of leg shaving ( world war I, 1960-1980,and present day) and should maybe include a section about how leg shaving is involved in athletics, but should not focus on the gender differences. In addition, this article devotes little space to the topic of women, but a larger space for males, I find this interesting because leg shaving is often seen as a feminine attribute and not a masculine one. I would have expected much of the article to be designated towards females, however I was wrong."

The issue is with it calling these ideas Buddhist without any sources to back up the claim that they are Buddhist ideas - and within a framework of non Buddhist concepts.  

 ::: It would be good to have a proper informed discussion of karma and comparison of the different ways it is understood in different traditions and problems with it. But this isn't it.  

 ::: Indeed if you check the sources given for many of the comments here - they come from a series of articles whose authors - as best I can tell (they are rather technical theological articles) - are looking at the possiblity of applying the Eastern idea of karma to give an explanation of why a just and good God can permit a world with evil and suffering in it. The article I read didn't claim to be an overview of Eastern ideas of karma - but rather an application of them to theology. That's why it is imbued throughout with ideas from Western theology that do not fit well with Eastern ideas. 

 ::: So - if this material is included -it needs to be made clear where it comes from and what the discussion is - and given its proper context, and because the sources are articles by Western Christian theologians - at least the ones I followed up - that is another reason why it belongs in the Western section.

 If there is a disagreement about whether meaning is always compositional in phrasal verbs, then simply put, it isn't. This isn't controversial - can you argue that idioms don't exist? Roidhrigh, do you disagree with this, or is your problem with the article something different? Do you think that there is too much emphasis on the concept of catenae or that statements about how they relate to meaning are too clear-cut and don't consider alternative theories of meaning? 

 Regarding the name of the article, the article suggests other names as well, like """"compound verbs"""". The name is confusing because there isn't a phrase corresponding to a phrasal verb. 

 Can I suggest """"A verbal idiom involving prepositional phrases and particles"""" as a definition? I'd also mention that particles have been categorized by some as prepositions.   """

 :::*Volgograd or Stalingrad? Volgograd is the single widely accepted English name in modern context but Stalingrad is a widely accepted English name for certain historical contexts. Therefore during the Second World War there was a Battle of Stalingrad, not a Battle of Volgograd, and when referring to the city during the Stalinist era, the term Stalingrad is more correct than Volgograd; Battle of Stalingrad mentions Volgograd once in the text; three times in describing external links.   
 :::*Istanbul or Constantinople? Istanbul is the single widely accepted English name in modern context, but Constantinople is a widely accepted historical English name. Now Constantinople is a separate article covering the history of Istanbul until 1453 and the term used to refer to the city in historical context before 1453. 
 :::*Vilnius or Wilno? Vilnius is the single widely accepted English name in modern context, but Wilno is  widely accepted  in historical contexts where the Polish language was more popular than the Lithuanian language (during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth).

 ==Explanation of Edits== 

 I have noticed there is a high amount of adding and removing of programing, and whenever it is changed from what some believe is the """"correct"""" programming, it is marked as vandalism and reverted.  I just want to explain why I edited what I did today - I removed Inside Out Boy and Hey Dude and inserted Secret World of Alex Mack.  This edit is not just because of what I think should be on the show, but is properly referenced to a Washington Post article, which is considered a reliable source.  

 Now, in the description before the episodes, it says not to edit without a reliable source, which I have, but also says that the shows are on the list because """"they are in the commercial"""".  I don't think the commercial alone is a reliable source - shows occasionally put something in a commercial that does not end up airing (Make It or Break It is notorious for doing this).  Plus, there were no clips (in the three commercials I saw) for Hey Dude!  I'm not sure about Inside Out Boy.  Either way, the list I have gathered from Washington Post, the schedule that Nickelodeon themselves confirmed, is as follows: 

 Aaahh!!! Real Monsters  
 The Adventures of Pete & Pete  
 All That  
 The Amanda Show  
 Are You Afraid of the Dark?  
 Catdog  
 Clarissa Explains it All  
 Double Dare  
 Doug  
 Hey Arnold!  
 Kenan & Kel  
 Legends of the Hidden Temple  
 Nickelodeon GUTS  
 The Ren & Stimpy Show  
 Rocket Power  
 Rocko's Modern Life  
 Rugrats  
 Salute Your Shorts  
 The Secret World Of Alex Mack  

 Now, this can change, and might change, but at this time, it is the confirmed list of what will be aired during the block.  Reference/citation is http://live.washingtonpost.com/nickelodeon-brings-back-90s-shows.html. 

 Also - you should check out that reference after tomorrow - the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Nicktoons and TeenNick Keith Dawkins will be answering fan questions and comments live on this article.  This should help clarify what will and won't be part of this block.  There will probably be a lot of people editing this page tomorrow, because of this, as well.   """

 In a popular Bugs Bunny episode entitled """"Hillbilly Hare,"""" a square dance caller starts the dance with the following parody of square dance calling: 

 """"Bow to your corner, bow to your own.  
 Three hands up and 'round you go,  
 Break it up with a dosey-do.  
 Chicken in the bread pan kickin' out dough.""""  
 This animated satire has helped popularize the commonly held and mistaken notions that one should hold one's arms crossed over the chest while executing the step. 

 The crossed-arm do-si-do also may come from the fact that the early teachers of square dance and contra dance revival were recruited from the International Folk Dance movement, according to an article in the Old Time Herald.

 Umm, its just an observation that newton's ROYGBIV spectrum is different to ROYGCBV which is how I see the spectrum and how it is described in wikipedia. I have read (I think in a book called """"the last sorceror"""" about newton's alchemical investigations) a theory that there is no obvious colour between blue and violet so they speculated that newton included indigo just to make the list up to seven colours for mystical reasons. There is a colour between green and blue and that colour is technically called cyan but I think most people would call it blue in a non-technical context so there are, in a sense, two blues in the spectrum. It  is my own suggestion that newton was distinguishing between these same two colours and he called them blue and indigo. 

 ROYGBIV is still the most common description of the spectrum but I think it is just copying Newton's terms and doesn't actually match what most people see (what do you see?).

Whatever edit I do, I’m going to send it directly to you, you will use the work yellow marker (or the wikipedia think that crosses out words), and then send it back to me. It’s perfect! I’ll gain a grammar teacher and you’ll learn Comic stuff from me (c’mon! if you thought Bane was from the 80’s, and you ignore who Alan Moore is, you probably are just a newbie). If you like, you could also rewrite correctly what I send to you, but I rather do it once and again, until the sketch gets your approval.  

 We can also keep the Will& Grace’s Karen-Rosario kind of insulting relationship. I loved your offensive comment about you visiting my holly mother –although she is happily married and doesn’t like homosexual imbeciles. As if!! I also, don’t think your artificial mangina thing will do for any woman at all. You should stick with transvestites. I don’t mind this, you big asshole, actually this gives me an opportunity to practice my slang.  

 You are welcome to visit me. And if you tell me in advance, we can go to the Playa del Carmen . Only we’ll also have to go to straight bars. Also, I’m not sure they have hotels with facilities for “special” people, Yucatan is to fcking 3rd. world to have that stuff. But we’ll work something out.

485bd4a1cb76beab,"""The term 'tense' would seem to be the least understood term in linguistics. It does not, and cannot, indicate the time setting of the verb because it only means something when compared to the time setting the verb relates to. 

 There are only two tenses, 'the past' and 'the non-past'. Tense is solely chosen by the speaker. Verbs relate to either 'the past' or the 'non-past'. This is solely determined from the context. (Perfect verbs relate to the time period that follows the one in which the actions or states occur. Imperfect verbs relate to the same time period.) The time periods 'past of the past' and 'past' occur in the 'past' time zone. The 'present' and 'future' time periods occur in the 'non-past' time zone.  

 If the tense matches the time zone, the verb is 'natural'. If they do not match, then the verb is 'unnatural'. Natural verbs can be taken at face value. Unnatural verbs require deeper analysis. An unnatural verb in the past tense is either hypothetical or is informing the listener that the speaker is less friendly than usual. An unnatural verb in the present tense informs the listener that the speaker is more friendly than usual. 

 In English teaching there is a structure described as a third conditional. All text books describe this as an hypothetical event in the past and all text books are wrong to do so. If the actions described by the verbs occur in the past of the past, then it is as likely that the condition has been met as it is that the condition in a first conditional (e.g. """"If it rains, we will get wet."""") will be met. Only third conditionals whose verbs relate to the non-past time zone are hypothetical. 

 That traditional grammar descriptions of tense are wrong can be easily seen from a line in a Bob Seger song, """"I wish I did not know now what I did not know then"""". Traditional grammar describes both verbs as being 'past simple'. Yet they cannot have the same description because they have different meanings. They are more correctly descibed as 'non-past simple in the past tense' and 'past simple in the past tense' respectively.   Mel Tisdale"""

My knowledge of copyright law is nil, and last night, the latest in a series of 4 or 5 pictures was removed from the top right of the article. The most recent was an excellent picture from the era where both Barrett and Gilmour were in the band. While the source was available, copyright information was not. I've seen this picture in many print and online magazines (Rollingstone.com, AMG), yet have no idea how to go about finding out who actually owns the copyright on these images. If you know of a source for usable promotional pictures (I'd take any picture of the band for use in the top right at this point), or there's an editor on the WP who is especially knowledgeable in this issue, could you let me know? -"

He has already been banned once for disruptive editing, he was not additionally banned for confirmed socking and just weeks after he was again banned for confirmed socking (2 accounts). He filed a sockpuppetry case against 4 users he considers his archenemies and the verdict was that 3 of them (among which me) operate from the same region in Greece (actually something like half of Greece). Since then he is always writing, """"warning"""" and whining that we are socks, posting his customized """"technical notes"""" and warning other editors and admins not to remove them  . I have warned him that he has to stop doing that , especially since the verdict was that no single IP was the same as was the case with him (thrice!!!!), but of course that does not stop him from going on in his usual loving style ... He keeps trolling about the cabal of nationalists that war against him etc... Even when I refrained from occupying myself with him trying to at last make some constructive edits instead of (s)word fighting with him, he kept slandering my name and using my absence as proof that we were """"socks""""... These and many more such edits are Draganparis' sole contribution to Wikipedia since day 1...

e994f46f0b4e02cf,":There ia also a cultural element to ethnicity that needs to be addressed, but much of this discussion seems to be people just expressing opinions with no real debate. I don't understand the claim that English culture is Germanic and somehow different to Welsh and Scottish culture, I also do not see any great similarities between Scottish and Welsh culture, except for those that they also share with the English. I think it would be better to discuss the sources of peoples POVs and try to come to a consensus on how to incorporate all points  of view. There is  clearly a POV that somehow English people are ethnically Germanic and distinct from the rest of the people of Great Britain, I personally find this difficult to believe. Even if one does subscribe to this POV then one has to accept that British/English people have shared the same Island for over a millenium and a half, and the claim that some sort of ethnic apartheid occured during these centuries doesn't strike me as very believable. Nevertheless I am prepared to accept that this is a valid POV, contingent on properly verified sources. There is also the question of Scots, which is also a Teutonic language, so should we consider the speakers of Scots Germanic as well? If one accepts that the English are the descendants of the indigenous British inhabitants of Great Britain (which they are) and also of some immigrating people (who possibly but not certainly constituted an invading force), that the observed cultural changed introduced by the Anglo-Saxons may just have equally been introduced by cultural diffusion over several centuries (and no one disputes that there was some migration, but Danes settled in the Danelaw at the end of the nineth century, and there certainly doesn't seem to have been any great displacement of indigenous people) and that the English language is not necessarily an indication of mass migration or a rapid cultural change, then it is also a reasonable point of view that the indigenous culture changed over time (as it had in previous times). Most archaeologists now point to greater continuity rather than any rapid change. From a linguistic point of view Welsh serves as a good example here, at the start of the 20th century the vast majority of people spoke Welsh as a first language in Wales, indeed immigrating English people who came to work in the heavy industries of South Wales in the nineteenth century had to learn Welsh. By the 1940s Welsh was a minority language. In A History of Wales John Davies argues that the Welsh gave up speaking Welsh voluntarily. He reasons that the internationalist nature of Socialism (strong in Wales) and the progressive nature of Non-conformists led to a consensus that language could be a barrier. He also argues that there is no evidence that coercive measures like the Welsh not had any significant impact. No one is arguing that there was a mass migration in Wales at the beggining of the 20th century, nor is anyone arguing that Welsh people gave up their identity or culture, they just stopped speaking Welsh."

 ::very debateable actually..... pretty rude response for a registered user! —The preceding unsigned comment was added by   . 

 PS3 is pretty much all areas. Although the fanboys here will try and dispute this.  However look at some independant specs   
 :Theoretical numbers make the PS3 look like a massive super server beast of ultimate performance. However, when you compare the cost of one of those to the PS3, you'd laugh at the logical fallacy. Sony claimed the PS2 would render """"Toy Story Graphics"""" on the PS2. I don't think even the 360 can render """"Toy Story Graphics"""" in real time. The cycle is probably set on loop. Sony claims they have god-like machine, but machine isn't god-like. Again. The only comparison with the Cell I have heard is that it seems as powerful as a 800Mhz Pentium 3 (using only the main core). Incase you didn't know, that's really shitty. But the 360's CPU isn't as good as it sounds either.  

 == Why are severe technical issues hidden? == 

 Hello. 
 I was wondering why all of the defects and technical issues are so hidden in the article? 
 Unless I'm missing something, the only acknowledgements I can find are in the launch section (where they have a link to the Xbox_360_technical_problems article that doesn't stand out at all, and is only linked for context of the launch), and in the """"Physical appearance"""" section (again, linked inline to the same article, but only linked for context of the light). 
 The issues themselves should be at least partially addressed right in the main article. At the very least, the links shouldn't be hidden so well. They are still happening, even on machines from outside of the launch window. 
 (Incidentally, for an interesting read, take a look at Matt Casamassina's ign blog entry about being on his fifth 360 here)   
 :Allo? No comments? I'd much rather have one of you (more talented) writers add this than me.   

 Nobody cares. Or everybody is to biased in the 360's favor to bother. 
 I don't care either way.   

 Because they get deleted by Xbox fanboys who can't believe the console is nothing but an unreliable hunk of junk..   
 : No.  It's because Wikipedia is not a soapboax.   
 ::You know, I realize that you probably intended to only address the 'fanboy' comment, but you still phrased it as an answer to my question. And WP not being a soapbox is entirely irrelevant. As it is, the link to the article about technical problems is now far more prominent for those interested in that information. So, the answer to my original question was: The article was broken. But at least now it's fixed.   

 ==Xbox DVD drive speed== 
 The Xbox 360's 12x DVD-ROM drive is compared with the PlayStation 3's Blu-ray drive's speed at reading Blu-ray discs (2x, or 72mbit/s, just under 9 mebibytes per second) but this is not clarified in the article. The way it reads implies a straight comparison of DVD read speeds. The DVD-ROM read speed of the PS3 drive is 8x or about 10.5 megabytes per second. Since this seems to be a contentious article I just thought I'd point it out that it's misleading and ambiguous. I would recommend either adding a qualifier that identifies the 8.6 megabytes per second figure as the Blu-ray read speed or just leaving it out. 

 Oh wait, looks like somebody already took out the reference to the PS3.

 How is it possible that enemy who was killing Bosnian children is now in Republika Srpska receiving pensions and money for their killings, and how is it possible that Radovan Karadzic is writing poems, and that genocide was NOT only to kill Muslims but BOSNIANS of all religions? 

 How is it possible that Pero who was Orthodox BOSNIAN fought for the liberty and freedom of Bosnia and for BOSNIAN NATION, now is called SERB because YOU SAID SO? 

 Who are YOU?  

 Who are you to tell Pero he is not Bosnian, and who are you to tell Mujo he is Bosniak, and who are you to tell Kristijan who fought for freedom of his native Bosnian city Sarajevo that he is not BOSNIAN? 

 Who are you to tell any Bosnian who died for Bosnia that BOSNIAN NATION doesn't exist just because - you said so? 

 It is obvious that Bosnia is an occupied country! If Bosnia were free and democratic country it would allow their own people Bosnians to be recognized as what they always have been BOSNIANS! Thus the name for Bosnia as well - bosnian BOSNIA! 

 Ladies and Gentleman, Bosnia is not the country of Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks! 
 Bosnia is the country that belongs to nobody else but to BOSNIAN PEOPLE OF ALL RELIGIONS.  

 Now term BOSNIAKS was implemented by the very same SERBS and CROATS and traitors of Bosnian Nation who all together figured out that in order for them to exploat and divide Bosnia they can't eliminate muslims from Bosnia via genocide and wars , thus let's recognize them and let's call them bosniaks, but kill BOSNIAN NATION by forcing every Bosnian of any religion to go into 1 of 3 religious categories: 

 BOSNIAKS - muslims 
 SERBS - orthodox 
 CROATS - catholics

 It was better for you ocupators who write this article that Bosnia had never had a war in the first place! 
 There was no need for Bosnian Nation to suffer! 
 There was no need for Sarajevo to be shelled for 5 years! 
 There was no need for mothers of Srebrenica to lose their 9 year old sons and get slaughtered and raped by evil! 

 Now you are telling me that all those people get killed and died because of what excatly?

 Bosnia was under Germany and Austria for over 100 years and we won!

d11000b7ae803457,"""== What about this theory? == 

  
 I'd like to comment on what I've researched on this topic. 

 There are medical conditions associated with nose picking. One is called rhinotillexomania, which is the compulsive picking of the nose, and can sometimes appear with trichotillomania, which is the compulsive plucking of hair or pulling the hair out of ones head, and can manifest in compulsively pulling hair from ones eyebrows, eyelashes, underarms, pubic region, beard, virtually anywhere one has hair. Other such compulsions include skin picking or cutting, eating, nail biting, the list goes on.  Compulsivity can be related to psychological disorders such as borderline personality disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Generally people who have such compulsions also experience excessive anxiety and distorted or poor self image and can be prone to suicide. People (including children) with these compulsions also report often feeling worried.  

 Suggested treatment is behavioural therapy [Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and Stimulus Control (SC)] combined with SSRI drugs. Because such compulsions respond well to anti-depressant medications, it is fair to assume there is a neurochemical cause. 

 This is just my research on the topic. I'm not a psychologist or any such professionally accredited person, I just read what I could find on the subject, and it's far from a complete synopsis of OCD. If you happen to suffer from this disorder you are far from being the only one, and I'd encourage you to speak to your doctor or a counsellor about this treatable problem. There is lots of info on the net if you need to learn more before you can come forward and help yourself. 

 Mate- that is absolute rubbish.  I know a lot of people who pick their noses habitually and they do not have these disorders.  You sound like a pyschologist with your half-arsed pyscho-analysis.  This isn't an article for scaremongering and pseudo-pyschology.  Stick to the day job.  

 I agree. Almost no one will want to know that, you idiot! 

 This is silly. Let's keep it!  

 : I WAS KIDDING!!! (see ) I was kidding! nooooo (wail of anguish). what the heck. let's keep it.  

 ::I was kidding too (except about the this is silly part). Should we delete the entire article, or what?  

 : well, it covers the subject in a serious manner, with medical links. I'd like to know where the quotations come from.  

 ::Two of the quotations came from well-known folklore and the third, about the furniture, came from a book of ironic aphorisms by a gentleman named Van Lane Ferguson.  Another from that book:  """"If you don't believe you exist, smell under your arms.""""   

 :::A kind correspondent has reminded me that the book is called We Bark at Midnight by Van Lane Ferguson, published by Tuttle.  This talk page is evidently the only place on the www you can find this out.    

 :::: Aoooooooooooooooooouw! Put the quotations back in!  11:43 20 December 2002 (UTC) 

 :::Another quote he sent me, """"I guess being an ordinary, everyday Alabama commonlaw wife just wasn't good enough for Edna.""""  The quote that was censored from the article by a humorless square was, """"I know he picks his nose.  I felt under his furniture.""""  The other two square-censored quotes, not from the book, were, """"How did you know I went to Harvard?""""  """"I noticed your class ring when you picked your nose.""""  And, """"You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose.""""   

 :::: I vote for restoring the censored quotes.  They were refreshing and entertaining and interesting.  There's nothing wrong with an encyclopedia that has a bit of panache and cheek to it.  Having serious information is one thing, but being dry and dull is another.  I may just restore those quotes myself.  

 ::This isn't the most serious entry in the Wikipedia, but this is the first time I've been banned to bad jokes, etc.  I put those quotes in, not entirely tongue in cheek, because I thought they gave an indication of the attitudes against nose-picking that society has.

 LOL. Thanks for the laugh!

 (ec) I got a request from Michael Paul Heart to give an opinion here.  I'm not quite sure why - have I made some small edit to the article in the past? I can't remember.  It's not on my watchlist, nor something I feel a particular stake in.  So I consider myself pretty uninvolved. 

 Having looked at the article, I think the timeline is (at least mildly) useful.  The focus of the article appears to be to present, in some comprehensiveness, all of the different contending translations and glosses that have been given for this biblical word.  As such it comes over as incredibly bitty  X said this, but Y said that, but Z said the other, but AA said something else again.  It's good to have the detail of what X, Y, Z and AA said somewhere in the article; but it doesn't make for easy readability, and the detail is a lot more than can be comfortably held (at least in my head) all at once.  I think what MPH has done therefore is quite useful.  It allows the reader to skim-read first to get an idea of some of the different contentions in play, then see the chronological evolution of different translations, then go back to have a second pass at the earlier presentation, this time perhaps taking in more of the detail. 

 One principle of journalism, which does I hope at least sometimes get applied in the science and maths articles that I sometimes haunt, is to think of trying to put over information in a pyramid structure  starting with something quite simple, quite narrow, and quite focussed; and then only gradually widening it, deepening it and piling on detail.  Compared to that the current article arguably front-loads an awful lot of detail  which is why, at least in my view, it may come over as so bitty.  MPH's approach of adding quite a succinct time-line at the end I do personally find for me does help to give a second, progressive structure and shape that all the different bits can fit into, making them easier to assimilate.  So I think, at least for me, I did find it helped; and tucked away at the end of the article, it certainly doesn't take anything away from the article's principal readability.   

 An alternative might be to move the detail of what X, Y, Z and AA said out of the initial thematic grouping and into the later chronological section.  Lightening the weight of detail in the thematically arranged sections, in line with the """"pyramid"""" view of article structure, might make them less bitty and easier to assimilate.  (Alternatively, more of the detail could be moved to the referencing/footnotes).  My fear though would be that even lightened in this way, those sections might still come over as unthreaded and bitty, while the extra detail would make the chronological summary less readable, leaving the article with two contending hard-to-assimilate presentations, which would actually be a step backwards from where it is today.  But worth still at least putting up for consideration. 

 On the narrow question of the article as it is today, personally for me I find that the timeline is helpful, and I don't think there's any way in which it harms or hampers the article, so I'd suggest keeping it.    """

 You might want to wait until after the election.  Did you announce all the primary voting times on the U.S. Page?  Think, seriously, think. 

 (2) On the example of Crimea, at least three major cities (prinves) in Eastern Ukraine have announced plans for voting on a referendum for declaring independence and/or self-determination from Ukraine. 

 OPPOSE  This Item should not be included.  No elected officials or representatives from these cities made this decision.  Criminals who have intimidated and tortured unarmed civilians have announced to fake elections on Sunday.  They recieve their marching orders from Putin. 

 (3) Daily reports over the last month in NYTimes and London Times of armed military conflict between pro-Russian and Ukrainian para-military groups in the Slovyansk and Holivka corridor (150km circumference) to the immediate west of Luhansk. 

 OPPOSE  It is the """"armed conflict between Putin supported para-military groups and Ukranian civilians and military in Eastern Ukraine."""" 

 London Times is currently owned by Rupert Murdoch, a man known for making up more stuff than the editors of this wikipedia article. 

 (4) Putin announcement to abide by 2014 Geneva Pact and offer/pledge to de-escalate the Russian military build-up on the Ukraine border from early MAY. 

 OPPOSE You do not post this announcement unless you also post that Putin is a pathological liar and never abides by his or Russia's promises. 

 (5) John Kerry 4-point plan of US State department to Renormalize Russia's relation to Crimea and Ukraine. 

 You could, not that the 4-point plan means anything.  Why not post Kerry's recipe for biscuits as well? 

 (6) Issue of economic insolvency of Ukraine (bankruptcy) in EU reports on economic viability of Ukraine to support Crimea. 

 OPPOSE You should post that the country had most of its wealth stolen by Putin supporters. 

 (7) Massive Russian investment in Crimea to underwrite Crimean international access (Passports and State Department programs) as well as pension & retirement re-investment guarantee financed in April. 

 OPPOSE  This is an obvious PR stunt by Putin.  There are no free reporters there and no way to verify what is actually happening.  Reprinting PR from Putin without clarification is incompetence. 

 (8) Russian military build-up on Ukraine south-east Russian border alerted by John Kerry as """"War-zone"""" readiness on 7 April. 

 So, It's still going on.  You should wait to see how things play out first. 

 (9) Further Ukrainian regional protests in other Ukrainian cities seeking Russian re-nationalization. 

 OPPOSE Are you people stupid?  Any protest without at least 10,000 verifiable people is not worth a mention on the wikipedia article for a nation.  This includes ALL the regional protests in Ukraine.  If it is worth a mention, then the U.S. page needs to have a few million more entries for """"protests"""".  Armed criminals supported by Putin could be mentioned, I guess. 

 (10) Russian authorized budget plans for Civic rebuilding of Crimea intrastructure including expanded new large scale spanning bridges for bridge links to Russian mainland. 

 OPPOSE  Wait for the bridge to be built, then write an article on that if you want.  They haven't even broken ground and you're already announcing it for the Putin PR machine.  Are you stupid or do you support Hitler . . . um, I mean Putin. 

 The armed invasion of Crimea by Russia after the Russian puppet president was deposed could deserve a mention.

I am simply answerin a question & he startz screamin or tellz me 2 shut up rite in da middle of mah answer & itz not like I have diz long, drawn out answer either.

It is not rite 4 anyone to yell at us, ever! And, the idea that we are overly sensitive is the biggest line of crap I've been handed. Yes, I got that handed to me too. There are nice men out there and the ones we are with now are the bottom of the barrel. Lets all dump these jokers and meet back here with great stories eh? my boyfriend is ALWAYS yelling at me. When I confront him about it and ask him why he is doing that (because he even does it when it is not necessary) He tries to tell me that he always talks like this and not to take it personally. He will tell me that while yelling. He tries to make it sound like I'm the one with the problem. He say's he's tired of me starting arguments. In his perspective, I cause arguments by not tolerating his impolite way of addressing me. If I let him yell at me we wouldn't argue. He's an idiot and I have to get away. Let's just say for the sake of argument that it is my fault for starting arguments. I am still struggling with letting him yell at me without getting offended and I should get away from him just for that. Because I have a problem with the way he talks to me wether it's right or wrong, I can't deal with it. I have told it bothers me numerous times and the fact that he still does it means he doesn't really care how I feel about it and he doesn't care about what I expect out of him. So I guess he probably wouldn't care if I wasn't around anymore...makes sense. My boyfriend yelled at me all the time esp. if we were fighting, Now I dont know what kind of relationship we have now. He knew since from the start that I am a sensitive type. and for real? I really dont like someone yell at me esp my boyfriend. We talked a while ago, I expressed out my feelings towards him that I dont wanna feel this pain no more. I cried in front of him. But he told me that he gonna accept what is my decision is. I hope its easy to move on, but its hard... Because I love him. All I wanted is his changes. But He told me that it was his personality since when he was a child. and it was hard for him to change it. What I am going to do? I love my boyfriend but I dont wanna feel hurt all the time. We are planning to get married soon... Do you think is the best solution? yes my boyfriend is like the king of yelling and making me feel like nothings at times...sometimes when I call he answer the phone like """"what do you want"""" mind you we havent talked all day so I at least like to talk to him once cause but he make it hard for me to even ask him questions he say that I questioned him like im his mother and all I ask is how your day and how was school its like he always got something negative to say towards me and then when I want to talk about the way he talks to me he says that I blow things out of whack and then that makes me mad so I hang up but he doesnt call back to apology or nothin and when I do call back I try to just move on and he still wnts to yell and carry like how im needy and that we shouldnt talk everyday...I just sp confused but when I have to do somethin for him he acts all nice and say how much he loves me sooo I think I might end this stupid relationship tear... girls! I have no right to tell you to get out! honestly I am in a relationship my boyfriend ALWAYS yells at me ALWAYS is mad at me right now we are fighting its been a week since we've hung out and I HOPE you girls are stronger than me! and get out!

 THE ABANDONMENT 

  	 Life sucks, the man thought to himself.  A twenty-three year old squatter, his whole life seemed to be a giant search.  Looking for something- whether it was in someone else, something else, or his own self, he didn’t know.  He just needed something to fill in that cumbersome, gaping hole of meaning.   

  	 Sitting down on the cold concrete curb, watching the occasional car rush by and the golden fall leaves that rustled up in the process.  In the morning, when he wasn’t working his shit office job, when he wasn’t hanging with his bitch girlfriend, when he wasn’t absorbing the bullshit everyone seemed to love throwing at him- he sat here, on this curb leading to his apartment.  Puffing on his pack of cigarettes. 

  	 There was something about smoking that had always attracted him.  The cigarette provided nothing to him.  It wasn’t comfort, it wasn’t a high, it was just the act.  Just doing something stupid and meaningless, something that never got him anywhere- but it didn’t need to, a stupid meaningless thing to look forward everyday.  The moments he had with his cigarettes had become more important to him then his moments with his girlfriend- more real then her.  The cigarettes weren’t smothered with the fake societal bullshit he hated.  He knew cigs were unhealthy, knew they were a money pit, knew they had virtually no beneficial aspect to them, and yet he continued to puff away on the curb- not caring.  It was like a mutual agreement of unaccomplishment, and that was real to him.

 A tag has been placed on John binny requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.  

 If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Every angle, in the system that speaks of """"congruent angles"""", has parts that are rays; but since triangles with finite-lengthed sides do not have parts that are rays, triangles do not have angles! You also misrepresent the usage in question as the American usage. It is no such thing.

 Firstly, just because I have not registered does not mean I have not been adding content to Wikipedia for some time, and I am aware simply from reading Wikipedia pages what the general structure should be. And the credibility of the content I add should stand on its own without my having to register first to gain credibility from others. I don't provide incorrect information. 

 And the term """"DAB"""" is really just synonymous with the Eureka 147 system now. The term used to be used in America, but they seem to have stopped using it now, probably because the acronym is the name used for the Eureka 147 system. So I don't think systems used in the US are relevant on a page about DAB - they should be linked to from a page about """"digital radio"""". 

 You also have to consider that DAB has only started selling in any quantity in the UK and Denmark, and both of these countries provide audio quality inferior to on FM due to the bit rate levels used. Furthermore, because of the inefficiency of the MP2 audio codec, which has to be transmitted at very high bit rates to match FM-quality (224 kbps is usually equated to FM-quality), DAB basically sounds worse than FM in all countries - with the possible exception of Estonia, where the handful of stations are transmitted at 256 kbps. 

 So I'm afraid that continually deleting the fact that the audio quality on DAB is worse than on FM is in actual fact simply censorship."""

1da67d633f12dc16,"""==Merger / relocation== 
 This page has been relocated from mouth ulcer and merged with the previous recurrent aphthous stomatitis page. The previous mouth ulcer page was predominantly about apthous ulcers and not about mouth ulceration in general.  
 *The new mouth ulcer page contains more information about other types of oral ulcerations. ( ) 

  

 ==Ulcers lasting more than 4 weeks== 
 I have definitely had ulcers that last considerably more than a month, on rare occasion more than 2 months.  If I'm alone in this fair enough, but otherwise I think the time frame should be extended, or an 'occasionally longer' added.   

 I, too have had such long-lasting outbreaks of RAS.  If you are unlucky enough to suffer these long-lasting outbreaks, you must make the acquaintance of a good ENT specialist.  He or she will be able to treat these longer outbreaks with steroids, either in oral (methyprednisolone, in this case) or subcutaneously injected form (kenalog, in this case).    

 Ive had once a 2.5 month sore after a severe toungue bit (blood) and practically a toungue piercing. I cant rmemeber how i delt with it.  

 ==chewing gum== 
 My two cents for all the other canker sore sufferers.... For half my life, I chewed gum almost every day, and for that half of my life, I had several canker sores every month.  Stopped chewing gum, and the canker sores have been rare.  (as both curious and masochistic, I will occasionally still chew gum, and have found that the more gum, and the more sugary it is, the more certain that a sore will shortly develop.)  The other bit of advice from my own experience is this: while almost any kind of irritation to my mucus membrance will develop into a sore, I've found that if I can get some mouthwash on it during the first several minutes after the injury, the liklihood of ulcer development is much less.  (Dhermit 9-26-05) 

  
 ==Rembrandt== 
 """"In some cases, switching toothpastes can prevent mouth ulcers from occurring. Tests have shown that Oral-B Rembrandt Whitening Toothpaste for Canker Sore Sufferers, for example, has been able to reduce the occurrence of ulcers by approximately 80%."""" 

 This sounds like advertising copy. 
 
 :It's also correct information. I've been using Rembrandt and noticed a definite decline in frequency of canker sores. Supposedly they have also done controlled studies involving that particular brand.   

 I am using the Rembrandt toothpaste currently, but I have my doubts.  It appears that the 'active ingredient' is simply not having SLS. 

 I changed my toothpaste too (not to Rembrandt) and found I had less canker sores. I think it's more due began brushing and flossing much more regularly than the particular brand of toothpaste. However, this is merely anecdotal evidence. 

 ==Campho-Phenique== 
 The article recommends using Ambesol (spelling?) or Campho-phenique. But the warnings on my tube of Campho-phenique Cold Sore Treatment states, """"If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison control center right away."""" So if you place this on a canker sore, it would be swallowed - although a small amount. Can anyone provide a answer to the delima? 

 ==Pic anyone?== 
 I was thinking that, I'd soon upload a picture of my recent Canker. Desirable? Appropriate?   

 :That could work. Given the picture on Erection I think a picture of a mouth ulcer would comparatively be well in order   

 ::Let me wade through the licensing literature first. Is it me, or does it seem like we're the only ones who care about this article, ATM? -   

 :::Ouch, that looks painful. I first came across this article suffering from an ulcer myself, so... I guess this is mostly interesting to sufferers! And we suffer for our art. Good picture though.   
 ::::As you can probably guess, I came here when I was afflicted as well. What really threw me was the lack of distinction between a Canker sore and a cold sore. Would you like to insert this distinction? You really think it was good? It was hard getting the autofocus to work right.

Don't want to be accused of spamming so I shall not name the site. Simply labelling the parts on it does not do away with the copyright of the orignal image. It needs to be yanked from the wikimedia commons. 

 == Can somebody explain to me == 

 ... why this article has exactly one photograph of a shaven vagina, while the penis article has three unshaven photographs? Shaving is by no means the norm for women across the world, especially outside of Western countries.   
 :Perhaps you should read this before you make statements like that. /  
 :: First of all that section cites no sources, but second of all I think showing a natural vagina should be shown. I always think about it this way; if someone who has never seen a naked woman or a human being would come to Wikipedia, they should be able to see a picture which shows how women are naturally, and then a picture of a shaven vagina should be included maybe with the caption """"in the late 20th century, shaving gained popularity in the Western world"""". But shaving is just a fad like everything else, shaving wasn't popular in the 60's and 70's and it'll stop being popular one day. The first picture in the """"human"""" includes a naked man and a woman. Wikipedia is supposed to educate, so a even if 99% of people in the world would get a navel piercing, the picture at navel should still feature a natural one as the main picture, and then include a picture of a navel piercing somewhere else in the page.    
 ::Two problems, AB. As BiT says, that section has no citations, and in my own personal experience (which, I'm sure you'll agree, is just as valid as an uncited Wikipedia article), women from the Middle East and Eastern Europe are quite a bit hairer than Americans. Even if it IS the norm in those areas, that's still hardly the whole world. Most of the world's population is in East/South Asia, and I know for a fact that genital depilating is not the norm there. Maybe this is all moot, anyway. It seems that somebody has removed every vagina photograph in the article.   

 == The Real Vagina's Picture == 

 This is a taboo thing in Indonesian Wikipedia. Is this also taboo in English Wikipedia? 

    
 : It would be real hard to get a picture of a vagina...    

 :: It's a common element in other wikipedia languages. French, German, Spanish, pick your choice. And most notably that is legal as an educational photography is never considered pornographic in most jurisdictions across the world.    

 == Cultural references == 

 I notice other articles have """"cultural references"""" sections. Wouldn't it be good to have one for this articles.    
 : I suspect """"Cultural Referencses"""" would rapidly become an endless list of everyone's favourite. Best avoided.    

 == Where is the real vagina? ==

 Would you mind if I make the new one?

990d8f3705bb0670,"== 8bitjoystick and the Inside Source on RROD Truth == 

 There has been some confusion as to wither the interview over at [8bitjoystick] should be included in the article, so I thought it best to start a talk topic about it. 

 As I understand it after reading Wikipedia:Verifiability, the validity of the interview as a source is in question as anybody could have written that interview. 8bitjoystick did predict the Ms and Bungie split and I am not against Blogs as a source of information, but without something that can be verified as a fact we are essentially left with a very well written theory. Now on the Wikipedia:Verifiability page under Reliable sources it says: 

  
 All articles must adhere to Wikipedia's neutrality policy, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view. Tiny-minority views and fringe theories need not be included, except in articles devoted to them. 

  
 Which suggests that Xbox 360 is not the article for this theory because it isn't verifiable. However for the Xbox 360 technical problems article, the source is perfectly fine because all that article has to go off, is theories. 

 Do you (yes you reading this) have any thoughts?"

We are going in circles because you are not willing to discuss in good faith. The bottom line is that you claim the Serbs had and lost constitutive status without being able to define the term or to point to the primary source to sustain your suggestion. The other side on the other hand had both defined the term and referenced the primary source. Since you aren't willing to discuss in good faith and since you provided no new arguments during this RfC I suggest we collect the arguments and the sources like in the 1st post and let other experienced editors decide. It's impossible to reach a consensus with someone who is not discussing in good faith. And you pretty much deferred all other editors from this RfC except for me and Director. If he had not shown up, it would end up your way just because of your disruptive behavior that makes people don't care what the article says, just that they don't have to deal with you. You posted a lot of comments without a single new argument and you are trying to push your way against the sources. Your behavior was so disruptive behavior that people rather left the discussion and left the article says 2 conflicting statements in 2 consecutive sentences, than to discuss with you. And this is not your fist time as I can see. I'm looking at your contributions and almost every discussion involving you ends up with a RfC and you constant disruptive behavior. You are constantly trying to ban other people that don't agree with you. There's a written trace to your behavior and it's a shame no one reviewed it.

 :::::Stop posting.  The previous IPs you used at this discussion were blocked, and now you are using this one, you are evading block, and everyone knows that.  That is why you are being ignored by everyone.  Anyway, this discussion is near over, and it is only Direktor and me still participating.  You desperately called for Joys help but he didn't gave it to you cause Joy is an administrator here and a senior editor who knows to recognize the situation.  Gregor is in my view the finest Croatian editor, initially seems he didn't knew about my sources, but after seeing them he left the discussion by saying that the change in the constitution should be mentioned.  Then Tuvixer who was the editor who first started opposing the denial that was being made by an already senior, but well known as nationalist, editor Shokatz.  And now there is Direktor, my well known college from discussions, the two of us have already discussed here on talk-pages during almost a decade more lines than probably all the books you read in your life. Direktor isn't indeed a Croatian nationalist, and he is participating here because of 2 reasons: he saw here a great opportunity of having a challenging discussion in which he could make use of his argumentative skills which are excellent, and because despite not being a nationalist, he does have some strong pro-Croatian views in the matters of Serbian-Croatian disputes.  He also knows how Serbian arguments about the 1990s are usually weak in sources, not because they may be right or wrong, but because the West backed up quite strongly the anti-Serb rhetoric and, as we are at English Wiki preferably working with English-language sources, that rhetoric ends up usually being easily found.  However, this case is different and the situation was noticed by some editors which know the danger of opposing sources without anything substantial.  You obviously seem not to care about your reputation, otherwise you wouldn't lie as you are doing in this last comments.  Not long ago, you criticized the fact that senior editors have more weight that newcomers (you).  That may seem an unfair situation, but it really isn't, and I will explain you why.  This is an online encyclopedic project.  This is not an online fighting video game as you seem to view it, although confrontations and discussions are obviously an every-day reality here.  However, the winner here is not the one who wins more fights and gets his will and POV included in articles, but the one who knows to be objective and neutral.  Usually those are the ones that become veteran editors.  Experience tell us that no one is absolutely neutral and objective in all issues and absolutely everybody has a dose of POV inside, but the winners here are the ones doing their best to work here always maximally applying the Wikipedia rules and principles which are written in a way to make you become objective and neutral.

 Again, how is the KKK, Christian terrorism? Christian terrorism should be limited to acts of violence commited in the name of Christianity. The KKK is a white supramacist group, where religious matters are involved. They happen to be Protestant, but their Protestantism isn't a basis, cause, or motive in their actions. The KKK is no more a Chrisitan terrorist organization than Eric Rudouph was a white supremacist. Eric Rudolph's actions were based in his view of Christianity. He happen to be white, but his skin color was not a factor in his actions. On the other hand, now you can see more clearly why the KKK memebers being Christian didn't apply.

 I noted that you requested some information on how to merge the paranormal project with the rational skepticism project.

Getting one side or the other to voluntarily give up on their project unilaterally would probably be difficult, if not impossible. If I might make a suggestion, it might work to change the name of the paranormal project  to something like WikiProject: Claims of the Paranormal or WikiProject: Paranormal Investigation, making it clear that the project welcomes both pro- and con- within its scope, and then propose a merger. Or, alternately, propose on the rational skepticism project page that both projects in effect merge into a project with a similar name. Hope that helps a little."

I agree with you (and Wikipedia) that raster image formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF, etc.) used under a fair use rationale need to be limited in size to prevent abuse and copyright infringement.  However I can't find any guidance on Wikipedia on the size of vector images, other than they should not be rendered any larger than necessary (the important word there is RENDER).  How large users choose to render vector graphics is beyond the control of myself or Wikipedia; it's like telling someone how many copies of an article they can print.  We can't control that.  It's the RENDERING of a vector graphic that's at issue, not the graphic itself, since an SVG is no more than geometric instructions on how to render a final raster image, NOT the raster image itself.  Hence, when referencing an SVG, """"too big"""" is not a valid descriptor. 

 Nevertheless, I went ahead and """"re-sized"""" the image to be more in line with pixel dimensions that would be appropriate for raster images.  I hope this is satisfactory.  Happy Holidays!

c33f74c4f49e1c7f,"""Castro as a public figure. == 

 The Castro as a public figure section includes the sentence: He features prominently in the propaganda distributed by the Cuban government, his own persona being intertwined with the Cuban flag, revolution, and national identity. 

 Is this actually true?  It is my impression that it is not.  You could say something like that for Che Guevara or for José Martí but I don't think it is true for Fidel Castro.   

 :I looked at that as well, and didn't buy it. All political groups produce such imagary - such """"propoganda"""", where it is found, is certainly not unique to Castro. Also, see Cult of personality where I've been working around some of the material placed on that rather spurious page. I believe that it should be incorporated here as well. Here is the section 
 ::Fidel Castro, the President of Cuba, often referred to as """"Comandante,"""" is a rare example of a leader who insists that he does not promote a cult of personality. When asked about the matter in 1985 Castro replied, """"although we have been dogmatic, and we have never preached cult of personality. You will not see a statue of me anywhere, nor a school with my name, nor a street, nor a little town, nor any type of personality cult because we have not taught our people to believe, but to think, to reason out."""" Despite this, Castro has been accused of """"bask[ing] in the adulation and servility of his subordinates"""" and """"creating a regime built around the cult of the personality functions"""" encouraging """"the illusion that only he and his select group of revolutionaries have earned the right to wield unlimited power over the people of Cuba."""" [3][2] Castro has also been described as an example of the rise of a distinct """"charismatic leader"""" common to developing nations, and of encouraging the """"Personalistic political regime"""". This theory contends that Castro has maintained power largely through highly visible, charismatic leadership and popular appeals to the Cuban people, though the administration is successful only as long as the leader's charisma lasts.

Sentences like """"Some saw the crossed metal as a Christian cross and felt its survival was symbolic."""" seem excessively sentimental for the cold-hearted encyclopaedia we're trying to be. Perhaps even replacing """"some"""" with """"Certain elements of the American Christian community"""" or something. Presumably there are also newspaper articles with people saying """"it's just two lumps of steel, it's not a cross"""", but these are not referenced anywhere. 

 I would also suggest that the introductory sentence """"which closely resembles a Christian cross"""" is mildly too sympathetic. Maybe there's a more objective way of putting it, like """"whose arms cross in similar proportions to the Christian cross"""", or even, """"which is claimed by certain groups to resemble a Christian cross"""". 

 I offer these remarks not as criticism, but to try and be helpful, it's really a good (if not yet very lengthy) article )  """

 Cleopatra has had the blessing of god and the great sounds of music. Cleopatra very first encounter with music was at the young age of four. It happened one day when little Cleopatra was watching a re-run/repeat old show of the variety called The Jackson Five show ,as Cleopatra recalls it was the very first time she had ever seen people dancing, singing and having so much fun and it was very magical while growing up, Cleopatra had no real musical background, just her grand mum the singing house-wife even so Cleopatra considered herself a pioneer with a mission to conquer the unconquered and to become the very best in everything she does. 

  

 Cleopatra was not the typical high school student, she had a flair for fashion and stood out on her own quite a trendsetter Cleopatra was never a follower but a creative leader, a compelling performer. Cleopatra is what rolling the entertainment carpet out is all about. She got the look, the style and has amazing dance routine that would enchant anyone from the king/god of pop Michael Jackson to mark Anthony not just a helpless romantic but a visionary humanitarian activists as well. Cleopatra produces, arranges, composes director, engineers, remixes and know to be the queen of many voices. Cleopatra also works with some local D.J.s and engineers in many different genres.

 ==Arbitration enforcement on Falun Gong article?== 
 Hello Vassyana. Please see the latest discussion, and the edit history of the Falun Gong article. I think the diffs will make things clear. 20kb of text was removed from the article after some editors discussed it a bit; a sentence was put at the top directing readers to subpages. I reverted this and asked for more discussion and consensus to be reached. Neither I or Olaf had participated in discussion of the changes. Originally they were set forward as """"suggestions"""", and then  boldly implemented them. In itself, this may not be such a problem, given that it's clear these were just suggestions, and someone went out on a limb to see whether it was acceptable. Ideally, you know, in this kind of situation there would be a lot more discussion before making such huge changes to this article, given all the acrimony surrounding it. Anyway, then I reverted it because it was not discussed properly, but it has been reverted again. I'm unwilling to do another revert right now, because I would basically consider that edit warring. Peredman is now seeking discussion on the """"new structure,"""" but I will not participate in any discussion of the new structure until the deleted text is restored. It would be meaningless. I understand the current circumstances to be an unfortunate and gross abuse of the consensus-buliding process. Since you are the mediator, can you please advise some course of action, or take up a course of action yourself. The alternative is that I could file an AE request, I guess, but I'm not sure that will be best.

 1) Of the three countries mentioned above has been the only one who has reserved its rights to territory in antarctica when it acceded to the treaty and that is why to Ecuador and Uruguay were not taken into account in Wikipedia article in Spanish .  

 2) the source of the Inter-American Defense Institute of chile, referred to Brazil, the United States and Peru in the section Countries interested in participating in a future territorial division of Antarctica, as these three countries are considered a higher grade in its territorial pretenciones in Antarctica.  

 3) It is the only country in peru the already mentioned (Peru, Ecuador and Uruguay) which in its constitution make mention of the rights Peruvians in Antarctica.  

 4) It is the only country peru as you mention it in their territorial interest was supported by the then secretary general of the united nations the Peruvian Javier Perez de Cuellar in 1984.  

 5) It is the only country where the peru has written several books on the ties between that country and the Antarctic.  

 That is why we will do changes in the section of the article of Antarctica, placing only peru as this in the Wikipedia article in Spanish, adding that besides what is mentioned in the Peruvian Constitution, I hope it is your approval, greetings and thanks for your time to dedicate to the article by antarctica."

Not only does it read like an advertisement, it also suffers from multiple issues (which you are aware of) - you added the tags (but then you rated it C-class...). In my opinion, since WIkipedia is a permanent backlog of sorts, I try to avoid using these tags if I can clean it up myself. I also try to avoid using more than 3 or 4, because it looks like an overload to me.

 :If the sources exist, please cite them. I looked in the Brisbane Courier newspaper (published 1864 to 1933) and the only use of the terms """"frontier war"""" and """"border war"""" that I could find appears to relate to India and disputes between Qld and NSW in relation to railway connections and other odds and ends. I did find one mention in 1912 of Governor Bowen that used the term """"border warfare"""" but not as a direct quote of Bowen's. So I cannot support your claim that those terms were used at that time. If you have the citations for colonial authorities using them, please add them. If these terms are those employed by modern historians, then let's be clear about this and say """"these events are now known as ...."""". As it stands, the article does need improvement and I can see why it has a POV tag on it. For example """"It is generally acknowledged that the European as well as indigenous death toll in frontier conflicts and massacres in Queensland exceeded that of all other Australian colonies"""" is vague and uncited (if it's such common knowledge, surely there are many citations available) and seems to be almost in direct contrast with what is said later """"However, we will never be able to locate or describe in detail more than a small percentage of these events. Thus any attempt to list all events of this kind will of nature (at least in Queensland), be more deceptive than revealing."""" (which is cited). We do have very good access to historic (pre-1955) newspapers online in Australia; it's not unreasonable to expect citations to contemporaneous reports of events which are accessible online, even if there might be a need to suggest (based on recent works) that these accounts might not be accurate or contain bias or whatever. And it seems these events were reported in at least some cases as I found without any difficulty this 1862 article and this 1868 article about massacres in Queensland (both of which are missing from this list incidentally) and both of which call them massacres and express outrage at the events (contrary to the suggestion that all these events were hushed up or approved of). If you are prepared to put in the effort, I think there's plenty of material to substantiate enough events with sources. When it comes to something like the smallpox, if there is no concrete evidence that it was deliberate, we should say that, but it is also OK to say that Smith & Jones speculate it was deliberate because of the US event and let the readers make up their own minds about what they believe. Perhaps we should look at merging this list with the Frontier Wars article (since the lede para appears to have been copied from one to the other).   """

This list would be superfluous if List of cities proper by population would reflect  the exact official population within city limits, as its intro claims, and as defined by City proper. However, the List of cities proper by population does not always do that. It often counts sometimes arbitrary core districts, or other subdivisions of populated places, to adjust for cities that have - in the eyes of some editors - boundaries that are too wide. Some examples for the arbitrary counting of core districts are Shanghai, Beijing, or Guangzhou, while the much larger (in area) neighboring Shenzhen is reflected by total population within city limits. Many attempts to correct this un-encyclopedic approach were denied.  World's largest municipalities by population was created after a long discussion, and after editors of List of cities proper by population claimed that municipalities are different than cities (municipalities are not always cities, but cities are always municipalities) and to create a separate list for municipalities. This was done. I have always been for merging (one column for the sometimes arbitrary core districts, one column for the exact official population within city limits)).

 A Neanderthal is a representative fossil kind Homo who lived Europe and West Asia to Middle Paleolithic between about 250,000 and 28,000 years before present. For over a century after its discovery, the assumptions about it reflected the prejudices of the moment: long considered a subspecies of Homo sapiens named accordingly Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, it is now regarded by most authors as a species appointed independent Homo neanderthalensis. 

 The first """"Man"""" fossil recognized, first """"human being"""" disappeared separate from the Man Current, the Neanderthal is the origin of rich material culture known Mousterian and initial aesthetic and spiritual concerns in Europe (graves). After a difficult recognition, the Neanderthals had long suffered from a negative against Homo sapiens. It is still regarded in the popular imagination as a being simian, crude, ugly and retarded. It is actually more robust than Homo sapiens and the brain is slightly larger on average. The progress of archeology prehistoric and paleoanthropology since 1960 have revealed a creature of great cultural richness.

 (Hook) 

 I'm not afraid to take a stand 
 Everybody come take my hand 
 We'll walk this road together, through the storm 
 Whatever weather, cold or warm 
 Just let you know that, you're not alone 
 Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road 

 (Intro) 

 Yeah, It's been a ride... 
 I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one 
 Now some of you might still be in that place 
 If you're trying to get out, just follow me 
 I'll get you there 

 (Verse 1) 
 You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em 
 But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em 
 Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem 
 When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn 
 What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world 
 Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me 
 I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly 
 And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony 
 No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he 
 From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n 
 Whether he's on salary, paid hourly 
 Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him 
 Whichever comes first, for better or worse 
 He's married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas 
 His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge 
 To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

 I'm not afraid to take a stand 
 Everybody come take my hand 
 We'll walk this road together, through the storm

 (Verse 2) 
 Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap 
 I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap 
 You said you was king, you lied through your teeth 
 For that fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped 
 And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back 
 I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact 
 Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was """"ehhhh"""" 
 Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground 
 Relax, I ain't going back to that now 
 All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW 
 Cause I ain't playin' around 
 There's a game called circle and I don't know how 
 I'm way too up to back down 
 But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out 
 Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't 
 This fucking black cloud still follow's me around 
 But it's time to exercise these demons 
 These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now! 

  
 (Bridge) 
 And I just can't keep living this way 
 So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage 
 I'm standing up, Imma face my demons 
 I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground 
 I've had enough, now I'm so fed up 
 Time to put my life back together right now 

 (Verse 3) 
 It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me 
 Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you 
 So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through 
 And don't even realise what you did, believe me you 
 I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger 
 I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of 
 My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead 
 No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise 
 To focus soley on handling my responsibility's as a father 
 So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it 
 You couldn't lift a single shingle on it 
 Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club 
 Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up 
 Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon 
 But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and

 ==Supranationalism and intergovermentalism in the EU== 
 This is NOT a relaunch of the """"is the EU a federation?"""" debate. I'm questioning the claim in the introduction that the """"The EU operates through a hybrid system of intergovernmentalism and supranationalism"""". It sounds like a very professional and wonderful sentence, but it's IMO oversimplified. Firstly, when one talks about how """"the EU operates"""", one should point out out that the EU in this case means the union-level institutions. It is impossible to say which EU institutions are 'supranational' or not. Dictionary.com: Supranational=outside or beyond the authority of one national government(...). The use of this extremely vague word in this article is in my opinion totally oversimplified. The interests of national governments influence the workings of many of the institutions' workings, but it is both legally and literally impossible to brand the Council as 'intergovernmental' or otherwise. It's impossible to divide """"the EU's"""" way of functioning into power type A and B. -   """

 :::Sorry for taking so long to reply. I wrote this long reply yesterday and ended up discussing a little of what I've been working on, when I had an insight and went with it. Why I'm going to close my account is complicated. It's part of a much larger thing. In a month or two I'll be beginning the process of fashioning a new identity by changing my legal name. I was born a nominal member of an incredibly pretentious and loathsome family, homeowners and club members in an exclusive zip code and the like. They disowned me when I was five years old, when my mother divorced my father, and I grew up in a lower middle class income household. When we had contact I was more often than not treated like an illegitimate mistake and a servant because even though my lineage was theoretically superior these parvenus had a great deal more money than my mother's family and it made them feel powerful to badly treat their social betters where it matters and whenever they could get away with it. I'm in my early 30s and still have their hateful name, which I haven't been able to speak for years, and live in the same state. What I read on my driver's license is not a name but a curse.  

 :::My identity here is still an aspect of that. It's still poor me looking at my pedigree and telling myself I'm better than them, hoping my long dead grandmother will come and save me and put them in their place. She was prevented and it has all been over for many years now. I also realize it's meaningless because I don't belong to Society even if I theoretically could. My mother could join the Daughters of the American Revolution but she hates all of that. Society can go fuck itself. I'll make my own.

 == Help with ages of rocks of the Mendip Hills == 

 Hi, Could any experts in UK geology help me with the Mendip Hills article. It is currently an FA candidate & another editor has queried the accuracy of the geology section. The article says  

 """"The Mendip Hills are the most southerly Carboniferous Limestone Upland in Britain and are comprised of three major anticlinal structures, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate.  

 200 million years ago the Mendips were considerably higher and steeper than they are today.  Since then weathering has resulted in a range of surface features, including gorges, dry valleys, screes and swallets. These are complemented underground by a large number of caves, including Wookey Hole, both beneath the plateau and at the base of the southern escarpment. There are also limestone pavements, karst and a number of gorges, most famously Cheddar Gorge and Burrington Combe. Springs, a number of which deposit tufa, are a particular feature of the eastern part of the hills."""" 

 & the challenge is: 

 """"Geology If it's Carboniferous Limestone, there's something wrong—or insufficiently explained—about the reference to """"200 million years ago"""" (which is roughly Triassic/Jurassic). You'd better check this. It's not necessarily wrong, but the Carboniferous was roughly 360-300 Mya. US geological usage divides the Carboniferous into Mississipian & Pennsylvanian: I suggest you make it clear in which period the Mendips were formed """"

 <Some thoughts.  Dorftrottel, (I just finally got to spelling that right dammit I ain't about to switch just yet), I found it a good hoot how many of those diffs from Postlethwaite fell into four categorys:  1.Something to do with LGRdC/Kurt + RFA.  2.Something to do with your opinions on inclusionism/inclusionists/""""trivia in general"""", 3.Something to do with Screambox that I seemed to be involved in(the irony is thick, I know), or 4.Something to do with fucking your wife/girlfriend.  Many if not most are linked at RFC out of context.  However, the one directed at Postlethwaite (second from bottom) you should apologize for, it is obvious to me at least that you were just lashing out.  Whether that's really your opinion or not is irrelevant, it went too far.  The one at Naerii (you're an asshole, not an idiot) was over the top to me as well, and even though Naerii's response said """"I agree"""", you had no way of knowing that's how (s)he'd respond.  The comments about """"switching names and making it hard to track you down"""" are a bit of a stretch, as you've been completely open about who you are and what you're former accounts did/didn't do correctly leading to blocks.  You've done nothing wrong as far as I'm concerned regarding being open v. being elusive.  That claim has no merit.  Even this new everyme account is linked directly to your IP/former accounts when it certainly doesn't have to be.  I applaud you for your openness in that regard as I find it to be the mature thing to be.  So all this to say (I won't be editing the RFC directly unless it gets too ridiculous), here's my advice, in a nutshell.  WP:DEBF and WP:DEDE.  Don't Edit Before Fucking, and Don't Edit During Euros.   Also, for the love of God Most Holy avoid Kurt and LeGrande (and now, apparently RP).  They bother you.  We get it.  You bother them too.  It's a big wiki.  You told me once before (I'll find a diff if need be) that you'd stop """"responding"""" to them at RFA/AFD, and you've started to migrate back towards doing that I'd noticed.   Let me know when you want the RFC that you started on yourself (mostly for attention perhaps?) deleted so we can all move along pleasantly and singing Kumbaya together.  Oh, and I'm hoping your new account gets a userpage as topnotch as Dorftrottel's was - one of the best on here (and not just because I was quoted on it...:-)    |    |   """

Consensus is a decision or resolution that all parties in a dispute or discussion can accept, even if they disagree.  Please take care to note the difference.  In day to day matters, such as VfD and RFA, a supermajority serves as a practical substitute for real consensus.  However, such operational conveniences do not change the proper definition of consensus.   

 Jimbo's decision forced a consensus that was probably already developing, but had clearly not been reached at the time he announced his opinion.  Regardless of its history, it's now a fact of Wikipedia life that virtually everyone accepts, and I don't intend to argue it further.   """

 Hello Henrik, 

 The 'Wikipedia article traffic statistics' is great! I see that Wiki's history pages get quite a lot of reading and are among the top runners in number of views.   

 For example (cut paste): 

 Thomas_Jefferson has been viewed 269532 times in 201004. This article ranked 549 in traffic on en.wikipedia.org.  More than a quarter million views! 

 I was wondering how many times a day the view recorder is updated.  I just finished making a few minor edits in the 'Thomas Jefferson' page and noticed that that page's viewer record number had not changed in the last hour.

 I have been an avid reader of Wiki for more years than I can remember and have recently taken up to editing, mostly in the History and Philatelic pages. I have made major contributions in the 'Pony Express' and 'Postage stamps and postal history of the United States' pages.

 Hello , I will tell you now something about my position, my thoughts and feelings. 
 Since yesterday, I`m fighting working on an article. I know that is a hard way, but I have to do it. Please check all discussions, than you get the right point why I`m doing this. Every hour one wikipedian visits the brandnew article and starting to delete everything. I even did not start and working finding the right words and in same time there is another one and wants to destroy the page. Why? Why someone is not cooperating and help out, give a chance? Most of them are extremly aggressive and do not a gentle nice work. They all take a walk around the wiki world and search for chances to get bigger. Do you think I am silly? They all doing a fast work..one of them deleted every 2 minutes an article! Thats what I saw later. 
 """"Is not notable""""..this is not enough. Must talk about and find options how doing the article. Do you understand what I`m talking? Look at Stuart Styron`s wiki page..they destroyed it and after 1 Year there are lots of broken sites and links on google about that. Thats not fair. He had the page more than 18 Months! If he did not had it before than would be okay, but lots of people knows him and are confused. The admins wrote that he is a fake and a paid seller! And all these things are public for everyone! Never get it from the index. Thats why I have to help out and clean a little bit. Only wikip. can do that. 
 And at least, this worker of the wiki family came to my site and deleted elsewell aggressiv without sending a message! And this guy was blocked! He had not the right to work on articles! So, I think it`s not difficult to understand my feelings and position. How I react, is how I react. The same way not more and less than that liar of wikipedia who was looking for Destruction! All workers here doing what they want. No one can really controll this and that is dangerous. Deleting a site is not funny. People thinking negative about it. It damage the image. That brings lot of the rumors and is dangerous. 
 Wiki must be responsible for clean up all datas when that happened. But who is wikipedia? We are all wikipedia, so take a listen, when someone got a serious problem. Ulla1956 """

 Thank you for your response Ghmyrtle. It is appreciated. I have read through the lengthy discussion you referred to and you are right that there is a lot in there. However, I would simply contend that consensus amongst large numbers of people who are incorrect, does not make them correct. The point is, the 'British Isles', as a term, is no longer recognised as a physical geographical description. It fails to meet that criterion because it incorporates both cultural (Ireland) and political (Crown Dependencies) elements. The entire article is riddled with semantics that have divisive and partisan meaning. Unless a clear definition can be put forward (and I doubt one can be), I think that because of these multiple factors, the entire article should be rewritten to explicitly state the inherent subjectivity of the term."

 RE the following: 

 I hope you do not actually work in ecology.  Unsubstantiated hand waving hurts the credibility of ecology.  The right wing quite effectively undercuts the science of ecology by painting us as handwaving hippies.  In the US the environmental battle has already been lost because we lost control of the framing of the debate.  Refusing to be constrained by little things by facts is the favourite technique of the opposition.  It only strengthens their hand when people on this side of the debate adopt their techniques.    

 ::Well aren't you charming mate?  I do work in ecology; I don't write encyclopedias or talk crap for a living.

 When the Albanians arrive on the Balkan and today's Albania, there is nothing else they can do except to take those toponyms. A large part of Albania is flooded with Serbian toponyms. Just as an example, I wish to mention the towns of Pogradec, Kor?a (Korcha), (Chorovoda), Berat, Bozigrad, Leskovik, Voskopoja, Kuzova, Kelcira, Bels and others. 

 Quote: """"(Dr Kaplan Resuli-Albanologist, academic and Albanian historian): 

  
 After him followed the Albanian scholar Dr. Adrian Qosi who in the middle of Tirana openly opposed the hypothesis about the Illyrian origin of the Albanians. With me agreed, via the printed media, several other younger scholars of whom I would especially mention Fatos Lubonja, Prof. Adrian Vebiu and others."""" Quote: About the Albanians, Wilkes writes """"NOT MUCH RELIANCE SHOULD PERHAPS BE PLACED ON ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY AN ILLYRIAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL TYPE AS SHORT AND DARK SKINNED SIMMILAR TO MODERN ALBANIANS."""" 

 Wilkes was proven CORRECT by science when the Human Genome Project's Y-chromosome study of European populations, confirmed that the vast majority of contemporary Albanians do not share an Illyrian or any Indo-European lineage. Quote: That's the way it is with our culture, which is mythomaniac, national-communist, romantic, self-glorifying. You can't say anything objective without people getting angry. The Albanians are a people who still dream. That is what they are like in their conversations, their literature...In light of Hoxha and 'pyramid schemes, Albanians are a people who still dream. That's just the way they are..."""" Fatos Lubojia - Albanian historian Quote: Albanian scholar Dr. Adrian Qosi writes: I can say that today appear a group of new Albanian scholars who do not agree with the false myths (About Illyrian & Epirote descent) and courageously accept the scientific truth that they are not whatsoever connected to these ancient peoples. I am proud that I lead this group and that they took up from me the necessary scholarly courage."""" 

 Quote: Ardian Vebiu Famous Albanian historian writes: 

 My personal opinion is that the issue of Albanians descending or not from Illyrians doesn't deserve the interest it has traditionally aroused. There is absolutely NO Illyrian cultural legacy among Albanians today.

 == Separating person from model == 

 Reading over the article, and the recent dispute here, whether an inconsistency was """"demonstrated"""" or """"claimed"""", I wonder whether it's a good idea to go into any detail of the physics model on a personal page. I suggest to remove all detail from the model from this page, and merge content into the page of the model itself (if that's even needed, on first view all the information is already duplicated there). 

 As for notability, I feel that if a reader is engaged in a surfing, snowboarding, or burning man community, you might find it interesting that one of his/her peers has published a physics model that suggests to unify the forces. If you're in the physics community, you might find it interesting that an independent researcher finances his works in an unusual way. Since there is independent public mention of Garrett Lisi in at least two fields of general interest, which are typically not related, I find this notable for Wikipedia. 

 One minor thing, I suggest to remove the category """"Cosmologist"""" unless this can be sourced. 

 Here's what I would suggest, writing it in a way that could satisfy both focus groups (physicists and surfers/snowboarders): 

 (leave the infobox as-is) 

 :Antony Garrett Lisi (born 1968; uses name Garrett by preferenceA. (Garrett Lisi's home page)), is an independent theoretical physicist, who finances his works in part through surfing and snowboarding activities. 

 :Born in Los Angeles, and raised in San Diego, California,""""San Diego native"""" Accessed 2007-12-03 Lisi graduated the Cate School (south of Santa Barbara, California) in 1986, received his B.S. with highest honors in physics and mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1991, and received a Ph.D in physics from the University of California, San Diego in 1999. While not holding a university faculty position, he is listed as a visitor at the University of Hawaii, and receives support from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physicshttp://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/11/16/science-theory-everything.html and the Foundational Questions Institute.http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/dn12891-is-mathematical-pattern-the-theory-of-everything.html 

 :On November 6, 2007 he posted a paperAn Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything to the popular """"arXiv"""" scientific preprint server, proposing to answer one of the fundamental unsolved problems in physics: Connecting quantum physics and gravitation, to form a unified field theory that models all fundamental interactions that physicists have observed in nature (main article: An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything). 

 :Featured in Surfer magazine,Surfer magazine interview accessed 2007-12-06. he has been described as a “surfer dude” who is primarily employed in activities outside of physics.  The San Diego Union Tribune's sports section notes that """"... Lisi has been painted by some with the stereotypical 'surfer dude' brush. Inside the scientific community, however, Lisi says he's had no such problems.""""  He splits his time living in Maui, where he surfs and windsurfs, and Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where he practices alpine snowboarding. http://www.fqxi.org/community/data/articles/lisi_garrett.pdf 

 :According to Lisi, """"Surfing acts as a great 'reset' button for whatever I'm worried about in the rest of my life. [...] If I'm struggling with a difficult physics question, focusing on approaches that aren't going anywhere, surfing allows me to get away from the problem [...]"""". About the initial reception of his model, he comments: """"OK, the hype (and my inbox) has"

 ** 67% believed that the """"US has found clear evidence in Iraq that Saddam Hussein was working closely with the al Qaeda terrorist organization"""".  However, the more specific misperception that """"Iraq was directly involved in September 11"""" was held by 33% of CBS viewers and only 24% of the viewers of the various Fox sources.

 :I stated *fact* about their position on vaccination and you respond with flippant untruths... You said:  """"...they really, really do think it's icky..."""" that kind of statement is patently false, and CLEARLY indicates the vehement bias of Solarbird. They CLEARLY state that they are NOT anti-homosexual, and then you come along and say they are, with no sources for evidence. 

 :Yes, """"anti-gay"""" IS A WEASEL WORD - from the Wiki page on weasel words: """"A weasel word is a word that is intended to, or has the effect of, softening the force of a potentially loaded or otherwise controversial statement..."""" """"Anti-gay"""" has no real definition, but use of the word """"anti"""" is clearly *negative*. Pro-choice advocates would hardly call themselves """"anti-pregnancy"""" or """"anti-baby"""". Likewise Pro-life advocates also reject the term """"anti-choice"""" because it is negative (and, according to them, false). Also, you keep saying there is evidence for your terms, but you don't provide it, answering that you """"have it somewhere""""... From the Wiki page on """"Weasel words"""", an example of the beginning of a """"Weasel"""" sentence: """"There is evidence that..."""" (What evidence? Where is it? What are the details?)  

 :Point being, CWA is vehemently against the term """"anti-gay"""" and very clearly, on many occasions, has stated the remark I mentioned about """"loving the sinner, hating the sin"""". This has been documented by me (hearing the broadcast), and I'm in the process of getting transcripts from CWA with this actual phrase in it. I won't put it up there until I have the source and can provide a link to it. I still will hesitate editing the page because one person with a chip on their shoulder is all it takes to drain the motivation and concern from anyone willing to help edit. 

 :Another example of your """"weasel wording"""" exists right here on the talk page: """"...I used to listen to Beverly LaHaye and Robert Knight defend gaybashing as a """"normal and natural reaction to the perversion of homosexuality"""". """"Gaybashing"""" is a """"weasel word"""", what does it mean? They have never said it was ok to do any """"gaybashing"""". Even if you could define the term, you still have to SOURCE links of some kind as EVIDENCE. 

 :You wrote: """"...but, in my personal opinion, actions speak much, much louder than words."""" This is a RADIO show, they only use WORDS, how are their """"actions"""" speaking louder than their """"words"""". Incomprehensible. Also, Wikipedia is not about your """"personal opinion""""! It is very obvious that you have an agenda, and a chip on your shoulder, but that should not be communicated on the Wiki page. 

 :Also, you write: """"I would not at all agree that """"They use the statement, 'love the sinner, hate the sin' over and over."""" They have used it, and I'm sure it's in their position papers somewhere, but it pales in comparison to the more common words such as """"perversion,"""" """"unnatural,"""" """"immoral,"""" and so on."""" Many Christians consider the *act* of homosexuality to be a """"perversion"""", believing this is not """"gaybashing"""" or """"anti-gay"""". One can have a real, compassionate love for a gay person and stand for said person to be fully protected under the law, yet still believe that engaging in homosexual sex is a sin and a perversion (of God's intention for sex). Plus, you are AGAIN making a *subjective* judgment, saying that even if they have said that, it """"pales in comparison"""" to other words *YOU* believes indicates they are """"gaybashing"""" and """"anti-gay"""".

eaf2440e9a0b4f98,"Henry of Poitou, Abbot of Cluny 

 According to the historian Alfred Richard, author of Histoire des comtes de Poitou, Henry's identification as a son of William IX was an error. Henry first appears as a prior of Cluny in an 1100 charter, making him far older than William's children. In addition, Henry is not named among the children of William IX in the chronicle of Saint-Maixent; I can't imagine such a prominent individual would've been overlooked had he in fact been a son of William. 

 To my knowledge, no early or near-contemporary source mentions any illegitimate children for William IX. That doesn't mean that he didn't have any, it just means none were recognized, or important enough to be mentioned. Henry's mother certainly wasn't William's most famous mistress, Dangereuse, who only took up with William around 1113. Raoul de Faye, who is sometimes listed as a son of Dangereuse and William, was actually Dangereuse's son by her husband. She and William don't seem to have had any children together. 

 Henry of Poitou was evidently of high birth, as mentioned by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Laud Chronicle. But he doesn't seem to have been a son of William IX; indeed, he was closer to William's age in all probability."

 :::::::::::It's not really correct to say that under the Australian Constitution New Zealand has the """"right"""" or even """"an invitation"""" to join the Commonwealth of Australia. A """"right"""" would imply that NZ can join regardless of the Australian attitude to this  and this simply isn't the case. During the initial stages of planning for federation, the possibility of NZ joining was a real one. But by the time the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act was enacted by the Westminster Parliament in 1900, the possibility of NZ joining the Commonwealth of Australia as an original state was no longer realistic. But since NZ was right next door and had a relatively small population it was still possible that NZ (along with other nearby British possessions such as some of the islands in the Western Pacific) would wish to join at a future date. The preamble reflects this by stating: """"Whereas the people of [the current Australian states] have agreed to unite ... and whereas it is expedient to provide for the admission into the Commonwealth of other Australasian Colonies and possessions of the Queen"""". This just states the political reality of the time that (in the eyes of the British Government it was """"expedient"""" (made sense!) for other nearby British colonies to jump on the bandwagon. One large British colony is easier to administer  not to mention is more capable of defending itself than several small ones. NZ does, however, get explicit mention in one of the covering clauses. The definition of """"the states"""" in covering clause 6 includes reference to NZ. If you read this carefully it does not say that NZ *is* a state of the Commonwealth or even that it *has the right to become* a state.  Rather it simply says that if it did join then it would be a state for the purposes of the Australian Constitution. Since it didn't join at the time of Federation the only possibility of NZ joining is now under Chapter VI of the Constitution which deals with the admission or establishment of new states. If NZ wanted to join, it would  along with anyone else who wanted to join  have to do so according to the provisions of s 121 which states that """"The Parliament may admit to the Commonwealth or establish new States, and may upon such admission or establishment make or impose such terms and conditions, including the extent or representation in either House of Parliament, as it thinks fit"""". That's not a right. It's entirely up to the Australian Parliament whether NZ  or anyone else for that matter  can join. But again, the chances of NZ joining now are of course almost non-existent.

 greetings. I've actually touched base with Xezbeth re: this. All the links (an accident) have been replaced and I now keep them in with all edits. The point of contention is that a particular user - CovenantD - objects to the cosmetic changes, which are in fact an improvement. Surely the comic cover featuring the character's first appearance is preferable to a blacked out and partial image of the character? While I have also rewritten some of the information due to the bad grammar and poor use of tenses, the chronology remains consistent. I have also added a section - with references - that describes the character's various transformations. This too would be of enormous benefit to a new reader. I suspect CovenantD feels threatened given the subject choice, but this should not be the case. Improvement of the articles can only benefit everyone. 

 Look forward to hearing from you.

4842a60ea3199dce,"== Categories? == 

 If there is to be a section for categories of attacks, then Islam-related attacks should be a category.  Better yet, the category should be titled Religiously Motivated Attacks.  This would cover Islam-related attacks, acts by the Jewish Defense League, women's center attacks, etc.   If Puerto Rican Nationalists rate a category, then the religious nuts should too.  Of course this list would include hate crimes against gays and would also swallow the KKK list as well.   
 Before you get all wound up, let me explain what i would rather see.  No categories, or categorize everything.   
 *If a person references this page to learn what attacks occurred in the 1970's, they should only need look at the section titled 1970's.  As it is now, there are 4 sections containing events occurring in that decade.  Eliminate the categories and list all by date.  Any categorized lists can be their own page if necessary, or a section of the article about the group performing the actions.   
 *Alternatively, it could all be categorized.  Religious incidents (sub-categorized by sect), environmentalist incidents, animal rights incidents, civil rights incidents, hate crimes (which would include acts by the KKK ... still religiously motivated, but most hate crimes are.), etc.  Assassinations would have their own category if they remain on this list. (For the record, I believe they shouldn't be here) The same for acts of unknown motivation. (If the investigating body doesn't know who or why, then either it is not a terrorist act or the terrorist group in question needs a new PR representative.  Terrorist groups claim their actions and attach calls for a change in policy to them, otherwise it is just a random act of violence.) 
 Personally, I'd prefer the first option. (but i still think political assassinations and acts of unknown motivation don't belong here.)"

 *The newspaper with the information is a reputable one (which means that it is known to publish only legitimate information). 
 *Moreover, if they published a fake news, Rainbow and Nickelodeon would sue the newspaper and they would lose a lot of money, and no one is stupid enough to do that.

It looks like Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by featured list nominations is done mostly by hand at this point.  The first step could start with the featured list logs, but unlike the second step it's not fully automated (the logs aren't quite regular enough to reliably determine who the nominator is).  What I actually do is run a script that parses the logs into an intermediate form which I check by hand against the actual logs, and then run another script using this intermediate form to generate the table format.  After updating the by-year list, the second step is done with yet another script that reads all the by-year lists and generates the WP:WBFAN table.  The second step is actually the easier one since it's fully automated, but it relies on the existence of the by-year lists.  I'd be happy to make the scripts I use to generate these lists available, but don't think I can take on generating by-year lists for featured lists.

 Thought I'd get some opinions here..  The word """"fuck"""" has been reverted several times to """"f-word,"""" """"f**k,"""" etc.. and reverted back again.  It seems to me that there's no reason to include the word in an article about a movie geared towards children and teens.  There have also been a few Mormon users on this site who have found it offensive.  Being a movie made entirely by Mormons, I would expect that there would be a lot of Mormons reading the article that would be offended as well.  Is it really necessary to keep reverting it to """"fuck""""?  I'm not offended by the word, and I'm sure many others are not... But we all know what """"f**k"""" means, and we all know what """"f-word"""" means, so what value does actually putting the whole word in the article add?  Furthermore, it has always been """"wikified"""" so if anyone is indeed confused (unlikely), all they need to do is click on the word and they're taken to the article in all its glory.  Again, my opinion is that when we're talking about a children's film, especially one that never included the word to begin with, it's in bad taste to put swear words in.

 I do have my own quarrels with """"Azerbaijani-American"""" but as I said, I am not going to bother..    
 About consistency,... I think we need to simply follow google books/scholar sources , and if there is contradictions in them, move them to the body.  For example, """"Iranian"""" itself has several meaning (linguistic, country of Iran and etc.).  But """"Iranian American"""" for example does not mean Ossetians (out of context).. usually the way the sources use the term is the best way to proceed.  But I am not concerned about other ethnic X-American articles and wikipedia is more about reflecting sources,then having consistency.    """

 For boys, they started to go to grammar schools at the age of six or seven. In the lower forms boys studied Latin grammar and vocabulary while in the upper forms, they concentrated on the poetry and prose of different writers. 
 After attending grammar school, most boys became apprentice and were trained by a master for seven years. This would then make the boys journeymen and they could work for wages.

 :Some friendly advice: if you're going to try to make educated decisions on content from Arabic-language sources, you really should take some time to learn at least some basic elements of the language. It's clear from both the discussion here and past threads like this one that you don't know much at all about it. While Google Translate is certainly a powerful tool that can do a lot of the translation work for you, it is prone to error like any such automatic program is. By learning even a little bit about Arabic and how it works, you can make more accurate judgements on what Google Translate shows you. 

 :At the very least, you should familiarise yourself with Arabic letters. This table here is very useful for this—it's largely how I learned. By doing this, you can more easily recognise names (which online translators often get wrong—this is actually a big problem for them) and can also learn how to transliterate them in a more standard way when you add them to the map or talk about them in discussions. After this, you can move on to learning some vocabulary. It's particularly smart to learn some words commonly used in news reports so that you can quickly direct your attention to place-names or other important information in an article by searching for them on the page. Examples are geographical terms like """"قرية"""" (qaryah=village) """"بلدة"""" (baldah=town), مدينة (madīnah=city), or """"ريف"""" (rīf=countryside); political terms like نظام (niẓām=regime), ثوار (thuwwār=""""revolutionaries""""/rebels), معارضة (mu'āraḍah=opposition), or إرهابيين (irhābiyyīn=terrorists); and military terms like """"حاجز"""" (hājiz=checkpoint), قوات (quwwāt=troops), or """"مطار"""" (maṭār=airport/airbase). Remember that nouns often have the definite article ال (al-) added to them as a prefix. If you feel comfortable, you can even try learning some of the grammar too. 

 :For instance, if we take a look at the older discussion thread that I linked above, you say that the source doesn't mention the village in question (البويضة: al-Buwaydah or with a less-standard spelling """"al-Boida""""). That's not true, but given that Google Translate says that """"البويضة"""" means """"egg"""" (which it does, just not in this context), it's at least a somewhat understandable mistake. If you look at a translation and it has a random word like """"egg"""" thrown in that doesn't make sense in context, you should immediately recognise that something is wrong—especially if it has a geographical term like """"qaryah"""" in front of it. Since GT has a helpful function of highlighting the original word when you hold your cursor over the translated word, you can use the table of Arabic letters (or your memory, after enough practise) to figure out what's wrong. Here, you can see that the letters spell out a-l-b-ū/w-ī/y-ḍ-ah; after accounting for the fact that Arabic uses an abjad and so not all vowel sounds are honestly represented in normal writing, you can infer that it's talking about """"al-Buwaydah"""". 

 :I'm not saying this to insult you or be mean to you; quite the opposite, I only want to help you. You're also not at all the only person who needs to do this; what I'm saying could be directed at most editors of the map. And I'm not at all trying to claim that I myself am at all """"fluent"""" in Arabic; I can't even carry on a basic conversation in it. But trust me, you'll be surprised at how much better you can obtain information from Arabic sources if you just learn a little bit of the language! ~~   """

 :::The root of the conflict between the Christian Abyssinians and the Muslim peoples of Adal actually dates much earlier to the 9th or 10th centuries, when Zeila was still Adal's headquarters  
 :::""""Many centuries of trade relations with Arabia began with the establishment of commercial colonies along the coast by the Himmyarite kingdom and these eventually developed into the two small states of Zeila or Adal in the north and Mogadishu in the south, where local dynasties of Somalized Arabs or Arabized Somali ruled. The kingdom of Zeila, centre of the Adal Sultanate, is mentioned under this name first by Al-Yaqubi, then in the second half of the 10th century references occur in al-Istakhri, Ibn Hawqal, and al-Muqaddasi. Later descriptions come from Ibn Said, Maqrizi, and Abu'l-Fida.

This has been done with several of the recent criticisms pulling small samples of content (regardless of fact) and ignoring the rest of the article, even when the article has contradictory information.  For example, the article about Beck's operation was used to show he thought the medical industry was bad, but in fact, the article quoted him as saying he had the best doctors in the world.

 I know that this initially seems a silly question, but I have a specific reason for asking it. 

 Presently, a young Swedish model named Anna Maria Moström is listed upon the page here as having died on October 14th; all 'News' results for her which I have found note her as being brain dead (the cause being a tragic accident). 

 The crux of my thought on this is that as long as an individual still has a heartbeat and is breathing, whether through life-support or on their own, they're still (at the very least) clinically considered as being alive.  There have been numerous well-known cases of people who have remained alive for years in a vegetative, brain-dead state who would not during that time have their name listed as a 'death' upon this page.

 * Origin section, first paragraph. The quote """"Many Poles felt directly threatened both by the prospect of revolution and by Russian imperialism in a new guise, which they saw embodied in the Soviet regime."""" needs a citation right on it. All quotations need to be directly attributed. 
 * Origin section, second paragraph """"Accusations of Żydokomuna accompanied a wave of anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1918–20, when violence against..."""" you've got the """"anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 19818-1920"""" redlinked, suggest piping the link so that the flow of the sentence is better. Perhaps """"anti-Jewish violence in Poland during the years 1918-1920"""". 
 * Origin section, third paragraph, need to take care of the """"citation needed"""" tag there. 
 * Interbellum section, fifth paragraph, need to take care fo the citation needed tag there. 
 * Need to take care of the citation needed tage in World War II aftermath (first paragraph) 
 * I'm a hair concerned that """"Chodakiewicz claims some 3500 to 6500 Poles died in late 1940s because of Jewish denunciations or were killed by Jews themselves."""" might be a bit POV. Is this figure accepted by most historians? Or do other historians studying the period have different theories?

Since its Mar 28, 2011 publication, info from """"Concerning Terence McKenna's Stoned Apes"""" - has been copied/pasted by many, like Mr Woolfe, without due citation. 
 As for this WP entry on Terence McKenna - my experience with it goes back to 2006. In view of that, and certain remarks above, may I note """"Concerning ..."""" specifically cites WP's """"entry for TM (which seemingly reflects ongoing tampering to keep a properly celebratory, uncritical tone).""""

I question whether WP policy and practice is functionally sufficient to ensure WP purposes - against an 'inspired' determination  of oppositional counter-purpose (TM hagiography). Whether appropriate edits here can stand against 'edit war' and subterfuge that's prevailed at this entry for years - is unclear considering, e.g.: """"WP editors wish to minimize Terence's significance, so I think it's good not to let the bastards get away with this"""" (posted June 2, 2013, by ‘foxfire’ i.e. WP editor Peter Meyer: http://mckennaforum.com/forum/mckenna-forum-group1/terence-mckenna-forum-forum24/stoned-ape-theory-mckenna-shlain-hakim-bey-thread3.3/)

 == Intellectual dishonesty by SELECTIVE word manipulation. == 

 Hi, 

 Could you please help with the posted views of Mdwh, Wiploc and 68.103.210.128?  

 Is there a way to lock the nontheism site? They are not discussing the issues first. They're simply stating that """"non"""" + """"theism"""" = atheism (rather than nontheism). I explained in the history notes that according to the dictionary """"non"""" can mean """"of little or no consequence"""" like nonissue, which doesn’t mean a lack of an issue (""""non"""" + """"issue"""" not equal to zero/no issue, just unimportant or irrelevant issue like nontheism). 

 But they don’t discuss first. They just “group post” the same point of view over and over again by joining two words from the dictionary to come up with their own personal meaning. In fact, that SELECTIVE MEANING from the MULTIPLE MEANINGS of “non” in the dictionary is their only citation or source, combining two words from the dictionary for their own personal point of view. 

 I do not have any more time to spend on this for the next few months, and I believe that Answer.com, which uses definitions from Wikipedia, will update its definition soon (I inquired and they said a manual update would happen soon). This means that a misleading definition reflecting only three points of view from Wikipedia may stay on Answer.com for a long time!

 Sorry for the late notice, but since you have yourself tagged as living in the Bay Area, I thought you might appreciate notification that we’re having an event Saturday!  It’ll be held at Hoyt Hall, an all-women's house of the Berkeley Student Cooperative from 3 to 6 pm tomorrow.  The main event page is here. 
 Anyone is welcome to show up, but we’re expecting a significant number of people to come who have literally never edited Wikipedia before.  If you’re an experienced Wikipedian who would be able to provide useful help to some of the newbies, your presence would be especially appreciated (and it might be a good idea for you to show up at 2 or 2:30 instead of three.

 I’m AWB’ing this message to all Wikipedians who have tagged themselves in the bay area.  I’m sorry if the message isn’t of interest to you; feel free to delete it.

 == Discussion after edit warring report and my explanetion == 

 Dear , thanks for bringing this issue to Edit warring notice board to resolve. Actually I am passing very busy time in my real life. That is why I was just reverting Zeijani's edit, with specific reason. But every time Zeijani undo my edits without stating any valid reason. My point of removing few names from that article is, Zeijani is trying to push few controversial people's name in this article. Form Psychonaut's revert list I count 7 reverts were done by Zeijani without stating any reason, but I reverted only 3 of them with proper warning and edit summery. Now  protected the article with Zeijani's revert, including those controversial names. In a quick review from those controversial names I checked Abdur Razzaq, Abdul Quader Molla, Motiur Rahman Nizami Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and Muhammad Kamaruzzaman's article, where a single sentence or reference was not stated about their Islamic Scholar identity. So it fails to provide wp:verifiability policy. I am requesting  to cancel Zeijani' s last revert , where he put these unverified controversial names. 
 I really don't understand why we really need this article? I share my concern in that article's talk page check here. I cant manage time to bring it to article for deletion notice board.''''''   """

 Hi Nick, I've really enjoyed having a print-out of your schema image.  We printed it on a plotter and put it on our wall.  Now, however, we need a more current one.  Can you tell me more about how you created yours?  When I import all the tables I only get two or three connections.  Did you need a lot of manual work to get all the nice colors and links yours has?  Thanks! -Courtney [christensenc {at} battelle {dot} org]  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 : Hi Courtney, The short answer is yes, it definitely required manual tweaking/intervention. Specifically, it required all the colored grouping boxes & comment boxes, and (maybe) many of the connections to be added manually - I don't recall exactly about the connections, as it was a while ago, but I do remember it was a bit fiddly to produce an image that I was reasonably happy with. However an update to the schema image would be most welcome - that one is from MediaWiki 1.10, and it's moved forwards since then, so if you're considering producing an updated version it would be very welcomed by myself and others as a handy bit of documentation to visualize the layout.  All the best,    

 Hi Nick (and others came here for a new schema), I am yet another fan of your (unfortunately outdated) schema. I don't know how to but can help for an updated version of the schema -not necessarily such beautiful. I added a placeholder link in mw:Manual:Database layout already.

The novel doesn't feature a machine that sends people into the bodies of their distant ancestors. Nor does it feature a conspiracy by a group of historical figures that are secretly working for the Knight's Templar. The novel also involves different characters (Al Mualim is not based upon Hassan ibn Sabbah, but Rashid ad-Din Sinan) and different locations (Arsuf, not Alamut), and a different time period (1192, not 1092). In fact, other than Al Mualim ordering people to jump to their deaths at the start of the game (which is later revealed to be a hoax to scare their enemies), and the fact that both are about the Hashshashin, there is hardly any similarity at all between novel and game."

 Here is an excerpt from the section on Groucho's Death: 

 """" Aged 86 at death, Groucho lived the longest out of all the Marx Brothers and was survived only by younger brother Zeppo, who outlived him by two years."""" 

 I've read this 10 times and it still doesn't make any sense. The only possible coherence would be if Zeppo didn't count as one of the Marx Brothers, but he's certainly listed as one at the beginning of the couple films I've seen! 

 I'd edit it myself, but I don't know which is the truth. Could someone who knows fix this?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 :Groucho had the longest lifespan of the brothers, age 86. Zeppo was the youngest brother and hence was the last one to die.  ''''  

 ::Or, to put it another way, Groucho died in 1977 at age 86. Zeppo died in 1979 at age 78. (Gummo died in 1977 before Groucho, at age 84).

938841d37789f7e9,"Drew Pickles grew up as a gay child. When he was just born, his cock was five feet long. It grew much bigger every second when he was very young. Drew liked to masturbate to The Wiggles, SpongeBob and Dragon Tales. His dick got very hard, and much longer. When Drew was the age of five years old, he started his first day of school, with a twenty mile long cock hiding in his pants. He always fucked the kids in the classroom, and splooged on the teacher, and he's destroyed some school propety with his large cock. Things were getting out of control. Drew fucked about 5,000 kids at his school and the kids got all horny and fucked everything in the school, and then they cummed all over eachother and made a swimming pool in their school of cum. When Drew was 10 years old, he liked to poop on his dad (who is now called Grandpa Louis) all day. In fact, Drew skipped lots of school because he wanted to stick dildos up his ass and poop on his Grandpa all day. When Drew was 11, he got this own computer with the Internet installed. Drew jacked off to Wiggles hentai and Arthur scat porn. He couldn't stop. He couldn't go to sleep for almost a whole week, just sitting there, jacking off to the pornographic Wiggles images on his computer. He couldn't stop! He started getting erections all the time from SpongeBob and Barney, so Drew visited the gay bar twice a day to strip for gay old men, and Drew received lots of money to buy dildos to stick up his ass all day. Drew was a gay stripper for twenty years. When Drew was about thirty-five, he was married with Charolette. Drew didn't want to be married with a woman, but Drew was tired of men for that period. But then Drew decided to fuck men instead of women, so he raped men every night when Charolette is sleeping. Drew does not want Charolette to know he rapes men at nighttime. Sometimes Drew raped Angelica in the ass all day, he said it was oodles of fun, so he did it all the time. Drew entered himself in the Boner Baseball League, and won every boner baseball game. He won the championship of the Boner Baseball League every year. Drew was sent to Barney's Penis World to play the worldwide Boner Baseball Superbowl! He did successful in this superbowl, and he even performed in the halftime show by doing magic tricks with his dick.  

 Drew Pickles starred in over 67,000 pornos. Most of the pornos had Big Bird, Wiggles, Stu Pickles or Barney in it. Drew Pickles made over eight-hundred million dollars for creating this pornos.

 :I am 100% sure it mentioned clearly that the name Borjigin means """"Blue eyes"""" in that version in its records about the ancestors of Genghis Khan (I think in its vol.1) and that gives me strongest impression that Genghis Khan's ancestor might have eyes. If any English translation gives other meaning, one would have to check the original Person text to make sure. 

 :2) I was wrong, due to lack of the book at hand, but not conflating about Bodonchar, the 5th son of her mother, not the 4th. I also misremembered some other things, but that did not mislead my idea.  The exact words of the Bodonchar's mother (probably called something like Alan-Hoa, red-beauty in my memory) said a """"a gold man"""" visit her tent and mate her without mentioning his hair. However, it is same when we call someone a blond girl without mention the blond color is her hair not her skin or eyes. In another language, blond girl could be called yellow girl or golden girl because the are just similar color. I also read the slaves of Genghis call themselves """"black head"""" in the """"secret history"""" (I don't remember where bcus no book at hand), and got a strong impression that it might be translated as black hair, namely, could be a suggestion that the slaves are Asians with black hair in contrast the the """"golden family"""" that might have different color. 
 :Dog was used repeatedly in """"SHoM"""" as a imageries of """"brutal warriors"""". When the priests from Europe talked to the Mongols, the """"Eternal Heaven"""" was translated as god. When Bodonchar's mother talked about son of heaven, it was quite possible either she or the """"later mongol historian"""" made a story that this warrior with yellow hair is a son of god. This is of course a speculation, and other possibilities exist. However, there are quite a number of other similar things that support this idea and it would be quite a increditable accident that all these material exist together while the speculation does not fit the fact. 
 :I remember in a seminar, A Mongol Scholar said the word """"golden family""""  exclusively means direct descendants of  Bodonchar, that includes the uncles or cousins Genghis that he killed.  That also remind me it might be a character Bodonchar's hair. My memory is not a RS of course, but I believe one soon or later could find the source, if interested enough. 
 :Now """"Blue eyes"""" and """"The stupid"""" In the society of Mongols, as well as all the other nomad tribes, the so-called family names were just from the name of the chief or previous chief. When a chief was dead, if his sons divide his slaves, they became several clans and the tribes names changed into the one of the new chief. But if the sons still were kept in the same tribe, like brothers of Genghis, they kept the old family name. The slaves share the same """"family name"""" that was actually the tribe name. As a typical example,Genghis has two """"family names"""", 1) Borjigin  from """"the stupid"""" 2) something like Kijan(), the second one is his father's name.  
 :According to the """"SHoM"""",the stupid"""" was very despised and bullied by his brothers. IMO, this name reflected the despising, however, he became a powerful noble after he captured plenty of slaves and other properties and he owns his won tribe.

 == Paucity of Academic research == 
 This is hardly surprising. I can't imagine any serious minded academic wanting to be Professor of Stupidity, or to be the Stupid Lecturer, or to hold the Stupidity Chair. Similarly, to have a Masters in Pure or Applied Stupidity from a Department of Stupidity Studies (DOSS) would (no matter how many Stupid Seminars one had attended) be unikely to enance one's academic status in an immediately obvious way.   
 :LOLOLOL   
 ::Actually it would be called Stupidology Dept.. The most needed of them all considering where this civilization is heading.   

 The fact of the matter is that there has been plenty of research, perhaps most famously, [Solomon Asch's|Asch_conformity_experiments] conformity experiments.  

 === Brain Damage? === 
 (I've subordinated this section to the last in part as a suggestion of where the stupidity research is being done.) 

 I can't help relating stup- to the German """"Stoß"""", which i think means a sharp blow. (The SA """"stormtroopers"""" were the Sturmabteilung"""", literally """"Storm [or Storming] Detatchement""""), but i'm pretty sure Remarque (in Three Comrades rather than ...Western Front) used the generic term """"Stoßtrup"""" for what i took to be Weimar-era SA or SA-like stormtroopers engaged in sharp, short street attacks.) 

 My full-sized print Amer Her Dict traces """"stupid"""" thru Latin words connected with being """"stunned"""" and Greek ones concerning """"beat""""ing to Proto-Indo-European """"steu-"""" which includes """"beating"""" in its constellation of meanings.  

 So i think we usually say """"stunned"""" metaphorically, suggesting the (temporary) effects of a blow to the head, and that the concept of stupidity fundamentally evokes the difference in an individual's behavior before and after the infliction of permanent brain damage by a blow to the head. """"What are you, stupid?"""" to me means """"Did you get your brains scrambled, and i didn't get to hear about it?"""" 

 Not sure that's encyclopedic, but then, i'm not sure the article is any more so. [frown]

 == To the contributers who add the names of 'stupid' individuals to this article == 

 Adding the names of individuals deemed 'stupid' by the contributer is neither big nor clever. Neither is it particularly original- a quick browse of the change log for this page will show many have done this before. There is no point, as the change will be reverted almost immediately. 

 Ironically, this is a great way to demonstrate your own 'stupidity' whilst unintentionally bolstering the credibility of those you seek to slander. 

 == OK then, for the sake of discussion: Is George Bush Stupid? == 

 Seeing as this page is regularly vandalised with references to George Bush, perhaps it would be healthy for the understanding of stupidity to define exactly why or in what way is George Bush stupid. It is not unusual for the media to label a politician as 'stupid' but it would seem that Dubya is seen to be stupid by an uncommonly large amount of observers. 

 Personally, I dont think that he is that stupid, although he does lack what most (North American) people would term 'real world experience' in so far as he is privatly educated, has never had to have a proper job, and is by any standard out of touch with the struggles of the middle/working classes. I think that his questionable descision making regarding foreign and domestic policy, generally comes down to his cloistered upbringing, and a desire to protect the interests of his friends and family at any cost. 

 So- is George Bush 'really' stupid? If so- why? If not- why do people attribute stupidity to him?  fdsfs

 This is perhaps a serious issue, and I am not sure how much should be said about what later became the """"Old Muskingum Bank"""". I have found nothing recorded anywhere about IVH's mangement of The 2d Federal Bank of Zanesville that I find reflecting badly on his character. However, his successor did not get on at all well with IVH's oldest step son who was also an officer of the bank and stayed on after IVH. An incident occurred, and appearantly this had bad effects financially on IVH through no fault of his own. My inclination is to blame Buckingham, his successor, for the finacial troubles of both the step son and the bank. One published history of Muskingum County Ohio deals with the incident and has David Marple as the primary cause of it, but hints that this was not the totality of it.

One account affirms that, according to a genuine Jewish tradition 'that man (who is not to be named) was a disciple of Jehoshua Ben-Perachia.' It also says, 'He was born in the fourth year of the reign of the Jewish King Alexander Jannæus, notwithstanding the assertions of his followers that he was born in the reign of Herod.'  That would be more than a century earlier than the date of birth assigned to the Jesus of the Gospels! But it can be further shown that Jehoshua Ben-Pandira may have been born considerably earlier even than the year 102 BC, although the point is not of much consequence here. Jehoshua, son of Perachia, was a president of the Sanhedrin — the fifth, reckoning from Ezra as the first: one of those who in the line of descent received and transmitted the oral law, as it was said, direct from Sinai. There could not be two of that name. This Ben-Perachia had begun to teach as a Rabbi in the year 154 BC. We may therefore reckon that he was not born later than 180-170 BC, and that it could hardly be later than 100 BC when he went down into Egypt with his pupil. For it is related that he fled there in consequence of a persecution of the Rabbis, feasibly conjectured to refer to the civil war in which the Pharisees revolted against King Alexander Jannæus, and consequently about 105 BC If we put the age of his pupil, Jehoshua Ben-Pandira, at fifteen years, that will give us an approximate date, extracted without pressure, which shows that Jehoshua Ben-Pandira may have been born about the year 120 BC.""""

 hello! thanks for the kind message, but i just don't agree with the premise. hk-the-general is not the primary subject, he just happens to be the first with a wikipaedia article to occupy the namespace. inasmuch as hk is a fairly common name, the hk namespace should serve as the dab page with all other hks listed with qualifiers per mos:dab#People. it was my intention to move the article on the general, but i couldn't decide whether """"hans krebs (general)"""" was actually the best choice. hope this is helpful...cheers!   
 :Okay!  I understand your reasoning now - thank you for explaining!  """"Hans Krebs (general)"""" seems fine - I'll go ahead and take care of the move, and of moving the disambiguation page to """"Hans Krebs"""", since there is no primary topic.  I'm glad to figure this out.

 :In the research I did a couple months ago, sources seems about equally divided between describing the Ganges as ending at Farakka or the Bay of Bengal. Certainly the river named Ganges (or Ganga) ends at Farakka. But obviously the river does continue on to empty into the Bay of Bengal via numerous distributaries. The Padma is currently the largest distributary and most sources that describe the Ganges as flowing to the Bay of Bengal consider the Padma (and lower Meghna) as being continuations of the main stem Ganges. Other sources describes it via the Hooghly. Still others consider all distributaries as part of the Ganges system. The whole set is known as the """"Mouths of the Ganges"""" after all. Although the Brahmaputra is larger, so shouldn't they be called the """"Mouths of the Brahmaputra""""? Maybe, strictly hydrologically speaking, but historically, the Ganges has been far more important. Also, the main channels of the Ganges and Brahmaputra used to reach the Bay of Bengal separately. Historically, the Padma was not always the main distributary. A few centuries ago the Hooghly was the main channel, and many others were before that. The main channel has shifted many many times over the eons. When it shifts, it typically takes over a formerly minor but named channel. It is natural that the old channel's name continues to be used. The same thing happened with the Brahmaputra, as you point out, which changed its lower course to the Jamuna a couple centuries ago. The former main channel is now a very small stream, but still called """"Brahmaputra"""". Anyway, I think your question has no simple answer. The Ganges Delta region is too complex, both hydrologically and historically, for a simple this-or-that answer. In writing up and editing the """"Course"""" and """"Hydrology"""" sections here, I tried to make it clear that the complexity of the delta makes it tricky to describe the Ganges below Farakka. Whether the Padma page should be merged with the Ganges, and/or the Jamuna with the Brahmaputra, I don't know. Maybe? Due to the shifting main stems, both the Padma and Jamuna have historical differences from the Ganges and Brahmaputra. This region has been inhabited since time immemorial, and the rivers named and considered sacred for many millennia. That, and the complicated history of constantly shifting channels, makes the question of which channel is really the Ganges or Brahmaputra tricky. Another point that occurs to me is that the Brahmaputra (Jamuna) joins the Padma before the Padma joins the Meghna, but no one ever seems to call the Ganges a tributary of the Brahmaputra (or vice versa). If """"Padma"""" was simply a different name for the Ganges, then the Ganges should be considered a tributary of the Brahmaputra, but I can't recall ever seeing such a claim. Anyway, I can't think of another example of such a complicated delta system, with multiple large rivers splitting and joining in such a complex everchanging network.   """

 2) http://english.unitecnology.ac.nz/barbwired/read_story.php?storynum=224 

 This is essentially a high school newspaper.  It fails WP:RS: """"Reliable publications are those with an established structure for fact-checking and editorial oversight."""" 

 Furthermore, the author of the article failed to do enough research.  Sources contemporary to the establishment of """"emo"""" refer to it as """"emotional hardcore"""".  In fact, the first usage of """"emotive hardcore"""" that we've been able to find is from a 1996 newsgroup posting by a record label. 

 I cannot comprehend the driving need by some people to rewrite history.  But the historical record is irrevocable - the term originated as """"emotional hardcore"""".  The usage of """"emotive hardcore"""" only came within the last decade.     

 :: Barb Wired is an online newspaper for New Zealand secondary school students. It is produced by Cognition Consulting Ltd and is edited by Phil Coogan., it has an editorial policy and therefore is verifiable. There is enough use of the term for it to be noted regardless of when you consider it to be have been first used. It isn't given any more prominence over the term you favour. You are missing the point. We do not get to decide what is true. Some other sources , there are also a good few record labels using the term and i think the most verifiable has to be the warped tour. 
    

 :::Having an editor and having an """"established structure for fact-checking and editorial oversight"""" are two entirely different things.  Considering the nature of the site (and the nature of the newspaper - which is to provide an open forum for high schools to see their work published), there's no evidence of any fact-checking of the articles whatsoever.  Providing a source is not enough - the source has to meet the threshold of the claim. 

 :::That doesn't even touch the problem of using that source in that sentence.  The term """"emotive hardcore"""" WAS NOT USED within the DC scene of the 1980s, which is specifically what that sentence is describing.  Even if """"emo"""" now """"stands"""" for """"emotive hardcore"""", it's irrelevant to the opening paragraph, which is talking about the 1980s DC scene that spawned the genre.

Napoleon was actually taller than the average Frenchman, but it's 100% fine for Wikipedia's article about him to mention and dispel the misconception about his shortness.  There are numerous myths about the holocaust.  Here are several, according to a Northwestern University historian: 

 *Anti-Semitism played a key role in bringing Adolf Hitler to power. 

 *Killing Jews was on Hitler's agenda from the beginning of his political career. 

 *The Allies could have saved more Jews 

 *Jewish resistance could have reduced the death toll. 

 *Greater popular solidarity with or sympathy for Jews in German-occupied countries could have saved large numbers of the victims. 

 *Killing the Jews diverted large German resources from the war effort. 

 *The persecution and slave labor system were driven primarily by greed 

 It's fine for Wikipedia to mention such misconceptions as long as we give the actual mainstream version too, as a corrective.  Your description of Wikipedia's policy about history articles is as accurate as the NRA's description of Hitler's gun control policy."

 == Odin Brotherhood == 

 Why don't you buy the book of this Mirabello guy, to enjoy his fantasies in origin?  `'  

 The Odin Brotherhood is a secret society claiming to  practices an ancient Germanic """"warrior religion"""" called Odinism. Members of the Brotherhood use the Eddaic Verses, also called the Poetic Edda, as a kind of scripture. The existence of the society was claimed in 1992 by Mark L. Mirabello. 

 Members claim their pagan order was established in 1421 to protect the ancient religion during the persecution of the """"Burning Times"""", and they insist it has existed in unbroken lineage to the present.  In its current form, membership in the Odin Brotherhood is clandestine–as in the so-called Illuminati.  The objectives of the Odin Brotherhood are stated publically, as in the legendary Rosicrucians. 

 == Mirabello's alleged discovery of the Brotherhood== 
 The Odin Brotherhood's first expose into the general public came to light in 1992 with the publication of the book 'The Odin Brotherhood' by Mark L. Mirabello, who is the professor of European History at Shawnee State University. 

 First contact was made when Mirabello encountered a silver-haired gentleman in a bookshop in Leith in Scotland while conducting doctoral research in history at Scotland's University of Glasgow. 

 The gentleman, whom called himself Lodur's Friend (in honour of the enigmatic god of the Eddaic Verses), was of eastern European ethnicity and was holding, according to Mirabello, a peculiar cane adorned with the images of the serpent and the ass, the two animals that speak in the bible. Both were examining occult books. The gentleman  noticed that Mirabello was studying a book called the 'The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross' by Arthur Edward Waite. During this encounter the gentleman pointed out that """"The rose symbolizes secrecy"""" while pointing to an engraving in Mirabello's book on the Rosy Cross. The gentleman went on to say that """"Since we speak sub rosa or 'under the rose', our discussion must remain forever secret."""" Several months passed before Mirabello saw the old man again, which occurred at the Atlantis Bookshop , an occult emporium near the British Museum in London, England. """"Blind loyalty is a virtue in a dog, but it is an offense in a human being"""" declared the stranger, when he noticed Mirabello studying an obscure essay on faith. 

 Mirabello has stated that since he was interested in the stranger's knowledge they became friends and that they began to meet for dinner, usually in Edinburgh or London, at which time the stranger introduced him to a """"circle of fascinating individuals"""". This gathering of friends for a meal (which only dined at night, during the time of the new moon), referred to itself as a conventicle, was by invitation only, and those that 'feared' or 'hated' authority were excluded. Mirabello states that those that 'laughed at' authority were welcome. The meals always adjourned before dawn. 

 Some years after the publication of Mirabello's book, the anonymous and privately printed Teachings of the Odin Brotherhood began to circulate.  Copies of the latter are rare.

 Watching the film, one gets the sense that it was envisioned as a two-hour MTV segment.  Events in the story flow around the music performances, which are presented in (almost) their entirety, backed in several cases by MTV-video-style montage.  I suspect the movie was produced specifically for the nascent MTV generation, in a bid to replicate the synergistic relationship that emerged between Saturday Night Fever and its soundtrack.

 ::Actually, , it's not.  The """"key description as 'privately funded'"""" is pretty accurate in that the first hundred million bucks of development, and the creation of the company was all Elon Musk, and another hundred million was from SpaceX VC investors.  In addition to the c. $200 million private funding, some specific development $$$ were paid by NASA for specific cargo vehicle characteristics that NASA wanted for cargo vehicles to take cargo to the ISS, and later about $75 million (to date) for specific development of crew carrying capabilities that NASA wanted SpaceX to develop.  Most of the other $$$ paid to SpaceX by NASA are merely the payments to date for buying two launches of a medium-class launch vehicle (these typically cost >$100 million per launch, although SpaceX prices to NASA are, I believe, quite a bit lower (per pound of payload) than the United Launch Alliance sells launches of its' flagship launch vehicles, the Atlas V and the Delta IV), or for partial payments for future cargo launches (12 of them under contract) where, due to US accounting rules on long-lead-time capital-intensive products, it has been usual for years in (even the commercial satellite) launch industry to pay substantial progress payments to the manufacturer beginning two years prior to the nominal launch date.  So SpaceX may have some hundred-millions of NASA money, but by far, most of it is merely payments for specific launch services, either already flown, or with launch vehicles in production, and a much smaller part of it is government-paid costs for SpaceX to develop specific product characteristics that the government wanted.   

 ::So you can't really count the purchase of specific SpaceX launches by NASA as government funding of the development of SpaceX's launch vehicles, the Falcon 1 and the Falcon 9.  This is all documented in a great many sources.  Hope this is helpful to you.  Cheers.    """

 :::The Alcorta paper, out of 27 pages of text, spends one page discussing ocher as evidence of early human ritual.  They find that evidence convincing.  Menstruation, however, is not discussed.  I'm unclear on how the Alcorta paper is a discussion of the """"entire"""" theory, or even a significant part of it.  My reading was that Alcorta and Sosis took the ochre-ritual connection as an independent theory, and ignored the rest of Knight et al.'s work.  Although summaries of the Hovers paper seem to indicate a similar approach as the Alcorta paper, even if it does discuss the entire theory as presented in this article, it does not fulfill the notability requirement.  Because Knight, Power, and Watts were co-authors of the paper , it is not independent.

 : Many reliable sources – a great deal mentioned in this article – clearly link NAMBLA to pro-pedophile activism, and a group for pedophiles. Even the term """"boylover"""" on WP currently redirects to Pedophilia, as it stands. Whether you do or not view NAMBLA as pedophilic is your own view; Wikipedia does not allow for original research and fringe viewpoints must not be given a false balance with the mainstream views. (For example, David Thorstads views on pederasty and homosexuality would be considered fringe). Obviously, subject matters such as NAMBLA can be contentious issues and as such, it's often difficult to make articles like this neutral. 
 :That being said, I think that it would help if this article went more into the broader historical context of NAMBLA, in terms of pro-pedophile or pro-pederast activism in the United States, and their relationship with the broader LGBT community. From what I can tell, most sources focus on the political aspect of NAMBLA, especially its aim to abolish the age of consent altogether. The controversial aspect of NAMBLA means that we have to be very careful when adding information to the article, and it also means that there are very few unbiased reporting a of the organisation, which makes it difficult to be neutral on these topics. If you have any information, provided it is reliably sourced and explicitly mentions NAMBLA, I'd appreciate your input. – ''''''(email) """

 :To sum up my position as laid out on my talk page: We accept """"pro-life"""" and """"pro-choice"""" as descriptors for people, because they are self-identifications; unlike other editors in this discussion, I do not go about editing descriptions of people to put in buzzwords I like. However, laws are not people, and cannot self-identify, so we have to treat them as we'd treat anything else and describe them in non-biased language. This can take the form of using a neutral descriptor - """"X supports anti-abortion legislation"""" - attributing the biased descriptor - """"X supports legislation he describes as pro-life"""" - or suppressing the descriptor entirely - """"X supports laws which would define a fertilized egg as a legal person."""" However, the latter two aren't really appropriate for a heading, so I think in this particular case we're obliged to use the neutral text. 
 :Dictionary usage moreover is against applying """"pro-life"""" to non-people/groups. (Interestingly, the OED accepts """"pro-choice"""" as a word one can use to describe a law, but I think it's best to keep the policy equal.) I used OED, Merriam-Webster, and American Heritage. 
 :I've been changing these because WP:NPOV is the standard we should be striving for. The self-identification rule allows for balance if not real neutrality, and while one might disagree, it's at least consensus. """"X is pro-life"""" sort of implies """"X describes himself as pro-life."""" If, on the other hand, you start letting biased text through in non-SI cases, NPOV is gutted. """"This law is pro-life"""" - well, it certainly doesn't believe that abortion is wrong itself, because it hasn't a brain. Who has described it as pro-life?

A diverse group of writers, the main figures of the New York School are Frank O’Hara, John Ashbery, James Schulyer, Kenneth Koch, and Barbara Guest. Influenced by relationships and collaborations with painters such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Jasper Johns, and Larry Rivers, the New York School poets are known for their urbane wit, interest in visual art, and casual address. A second generation of New York School poets grew up in the 1960s and included Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley, Ron Padgett, and Anne Waldman.""""

1b4756e124679bfa,"""The Wikipedia article on the Battle of Olustee tends to perpetuate racial division and strife by gratuitously stating that Confederate soldiers """"murdered"""" black Union prisoners.  Successive generations of Americans have been burdened with revisionist history about the Civil War. This reference to """"murder"""" turns the article into a socio-political discussion which is part of a new trend of revisionist history that attempts to assign the moral high ground to certain political philosophies and to groups of people which it is now politically correct to recognize as """"oppressed"""". The reference to """"murder"""" (which is an emotional hot-button and a value judgment) should either be left out of the article or the events should be placed in a proper historical perspective.  """"Murder"""" is a term of art, not an objective fact. Most, if not all, of the black troops involved in the Battle of Olustee were runaway slaves which the Union had encouraged to leave their masters and enlist in the Union army. These same troops had marauded East Florida, destroying Southern homes, farms and businesses, crops and livestock, and had burned Jacksonville, under Lincoln's """"scorched earth"""" policy of making war on the Southern civilian populace. Under the Slave Laws, sanctioned by the U.S. Government, that had been in effect since Florida was acquired from Spain and became a U.S. Territory in 1821, it was a capital offense for a slave to take up arms against a white person. Blacks (originally sold into slavery by their African brethren), aligned with various native American tribes who routinely """"murdered"""", enslaved, and usurped the lands of other native Americans, had been randomly massacring whites (men, women and children) in Florida and south Georgia since Florida became a Territory.  The massacres peaked during the slave revolt in 1835 and the Second Seminole War. Forty years of massacres of whites and destruction of their property, and more recent years of wholesale destruction of civilian property by the Union, which were participated in by blacks, were undoubtedly fresh in the minds of the Confederate soldiers at Olustee.  Under the new revisionist interpretation of history, if blacks killed whites, the Blacks were courageous freedom fighters.  But if whites killed blacks, the blacks were """"murdered"""" by morally depraved whites.  If we are going to open a discussion about socially-sanctioned """"murder"""", let’s not call it “history”.  Once we rid ourselves of the “history” mantle, we can engage in a morally-weighted philosophical discussion about the tens of millions of non-combatants (including prisoners of war) """"murdered"""" by our now great friends, the Germans and Japanese, in the twentieth century.

 The Wikipedia article should start with a plain citation of the first amendment before launching into a breakdown of its components or any explanation of the amendment.

 The first amendment to the Constitution of the United States is,  

 """"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."""" 

 Citation: The Constitution of The United States 

 Not doing so fails to allow the reader to interpret and judge the discussion in full knowledge of the amendment itself. I can see no good reason for creating such a situation, and can easily see how it opens the door to those who wish to persuade the reader to adopt a particular interpretation, lacking reference to the amendment itself.

Because in reality this image is the only recognizable visual symbol that the cabinet has. 
 Another issue here is whether the cabinet can in principle be the subject of copyright for the image, as they claim on the website. Well, the cabinet is neither a physical, nor a legal entity (as you come from civil law you probably know what this means). So, it cannot be the author of the image, since an author must be a phycial entity (the copyright law defines this). Nor can it be an entity to whom the copyright was transferred, since an entity is restricted to either physical entities or legal entities. Nice loophole, isn't it?"

 :(Tip: I've found that in order for a category alphabetization change to take effect, that first, on the article page, delete the category tag (i.e.: [[Category:Example]]), save the page. Then re-add the tag with the desired alphabetization characters (i.e.: [[Category:Example|*Example]]), and save the page again. It's a bug, I think. Also, sometimes it takes a few minutes for these changes to show up on the category page.) 

 :Whether Electronics and Mathematics articles should be changed... I think it makes it easier to locate the main article about the topic.

 Hello , I would like to answer in regarding to the topic Serbs of Croatia. If you look at this previous discussion you will see the very same pattern. Serbian orthodox church was established in 1920 and this user tried to push the edit that Tesla's father was Serbian orthodox priest, a non-existent term in the 19th century. Much in the same manner, he posted sources that simply bring the claim. That was finally resolved with a RfC so maybe that is the way to go here. I think your edit is right and that other's are pushing Serbian POV, not just POV but Serbian wartime propaganda. I suggest you gather your sources which reference the primary source and elaborate on the matter and open a RfC. There you can state that all of the sources that say otherwise do not bring any reference or any quote from the primary source. Also I think that another edit should state that although that claim was much publicized during wartime, it was never put before the Badinter's commission which was established just for that cases, to deal with legal questions. That clearly shows that this was nothing but a wartime propaganda. It only surprises that there are people still repeating it. I don't think you will be able to discuss in good faith with those people. I tried and you saw what happened to me. A discussion in good faith would be similar to the one I purposed. I don't know if you saw my last message, so I will repeat an argument I made which is pretty solid from the logical point of view: We have 2 identical terms from Yugoslav and from SRC constitution that specify who constituted a state (SFRY,SRC). Yugoslav constitution says: """"Yugoslav nations,..., along with nationalities...have created SFRY"""" while SRC constitution says: """"Croatian nation, along with Serbian nationa and nationalities in Croatia...constituted SRFY"""". The use of """"along with"""" is a standard legal formulation to specify the subject, but not to neglect the """"others"""". In my opinion this is the main point of interest. The sentence you are pointing out (national state of Croatians...) is just derived from that definition. However this is an interpretation of the source, and you could point this arguments if you had someone who discusses in good faith. There's not much point into mentioning this arguments when you are discussing with POV pushers. The best way is to open a RfC and briefly elaborate the issue that one group of sources say something but does not give any elaboration or any reference to the primary source and that another group of the sources says something opposite, and directly references the primary source. Also point out that Tuvixer is interpreting the source. The fact that does not bother FkpCascais while on the other hand he is heavily attacking you that you are the one interpreting. In fact, if you go to the beginning of the discussion, you will see that before FkpCascais had presented any source as the basis for his opinion he said: """"I share passion for law and I fully agree with Tuvixer in his interpretation."""". He had no problem into accepting the """"interpretation"""" of the primary source whilst he now has strong objections. At the point he posted his first comment your sources were the only one presented, and yet he disregarded them for an interpretation of the primary source, he even made his own interpretations. I mean what, if that does not point out that he is not discussing in good faith, what else? If you look at his past discussions you will see that he and the same group of people always appear and push Serbian POV while accusing the other side of POV pushing. At the end, if you don't back down, you turn out to be the pusher because it's simply more of them. In any case, I suggest you don't get involved too much since FkpCascais already started with the same pattern of accusations that you are a pusher. He writes them every now and then, so at the end it really seems like you are pushing. You will get blocked if you get too involved and that's what happened to several other people dealing with this group of editors who seem to be present of Croatian articles, pushing Serbian POV.

 OneGuy has unilaterally deleted the link to onesuck as """"spam"""".  I have reverted it pending the result of these numerous votes.

 ::: We are discussing it, yes, but I haven't seen you discuss it. When you revert to the previous version at least post some justification as to why you think that version is better. This poll was setup just few minutes before you reverted the page. Tony Sidaway and SPU (basically two people) want to insert a link to this site porn site: solosuck.com. If you go to the site, it's basically a site setup to sell video tapes for 50 dollars. Like all other porn sites, it has some sample pictures and video clips, but basically the site is a commercial porn site selling video tapes. Search the web and you will find thousands of other porn sites on this topic selling something.  Why should we randomly choose one commercial porn site and give them free advertisement on Wikipedia? Since you reverted the page to the version with spam link, I would like to see your justification   

 :: If you find one with better stills and video clips, or better yet, one with stills and video clips and other useful content, we can discuss whether to list than one.  Meanwhile I think solosuck is very good. |  

 :::It's your opinion that this spam site selling video tapes is good. I think it's a pathetic site. Who cares what I or you think?  Every spammer thinks his site is excellent. You are linking to a site that is basic"

 There is some back and forth on the wording of the lead.  What is the contention?  Certainly the Yamato class were the largest in terms of tonnage, but not the longest, as that goes to the Iowa class I believe.  Is """"large"""" tied to the ships length?  I believe that is the convention, as that was how liners that competed for the distinction in the inter-war years were described, the largest liner being considered the one with greatest length.  As to powerful vs. powerfully armed, I would prefer wording them the most powerfully armed, but the heaviest gunned might be the best descriptor.  Most powerful, would that be determined on the basis of the caliber of her main armament, the metal weight of her broadside, or the rate of weight put out over a period of time?  It seems to me these terms are discussed somewhere, and we should find a key and come to a consensus.    """

 #:: I expected this to be a problem, but actually the sourcing is impeccable.  Good job! 
 #It is broad in its coverage.

 #:No edit wars, etc.:

Your entire argument seems to be 'caught in a legal definition'. Can you show me a law that says that only the Doctor of Medicine Degree may be legaly refered to as a medical degree? Claiming that non-MDs do not practice medicine is not something that you have ever been able to back up. I have shown you a reference that the US Dept of education recognizes many types of medical degrees. We know (to use the example with which I am best acquanted) that NDs are legally entitiled to perform medical evaluations, diagnose medical diseases and provide medical treatment in 21 jurisdictions. Show me a reference that legaly and comprehensively defines and restricts the term 'medical degree'. It simply is not a legal term. Even if you could find a comprehensive, relevant legal restriction on the term 'medical degree', it could not negate the fact that non-NDs do practice medicine. Still waiting for an answer to my question above - about the ND who diagnoses and treats diabetes. Do you honestly believe that her degree was not a medical one? If so what would you call it? A 'naturopathic medical degree'? If so, can we abandon the dead end legal argument and focus on your semantic/common usage concerns?"

Armenian Genocide denial is clearly the site of some heated editing, and on controversial topics like that, the letter of the NPOV and reliable sources policies are the least of the problems that make it hard to forge a good, stable article.  Browse the talk page of that article to see what debates on such issues often look like. 

 That's something to keep in mind as your students choose articles to work on; large, well-argued topics like Armenia Genocide, or even 2008 South Ossetia war, will be major challenges for students to effectively improve—although it's certainly possible, and success would be a great contribution.  In general, granular sub-topics related to such issues might make better projects for the students. 

 As for link formatting, I reformatted the links on the course discussion page so you can see the wiki markup for links.  Any page on English Wikipedia can be linked by enclosing everything after http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ in two pairs of brackets.  So this: 

 [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] 

 looks like this: 
 Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. 

 You can change the displayed text of a link by adding a pipe after the page name, followed by the text you want to display.  So this: 

 [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|The Wikipedia policy about neutrality]] 

 looks like this: 
 The Wikipedia policy about neutrality. 

 You can also link to pages on other Wikimedia sites by using their """"interwiki"""" prefixes.  For example, the essay on Meta-Wiki that you pointed to could be linked like this: 

 [[meta:Borderline case|Borderline case]]

If you engage in slimy tactics because you think it'll help you win an argument, you don't get to misdirect attention on the person who pointed out that you did so.

 :::::::""""What these articles show is that the WP “community” and our readers are perfectly fine with the current versions of these articles, and have been for years as far as Orlan and William Pope.L are concerned."""" No, they do not. As I stated before, this is assumption on your part. I'll ask you again, do you have any evidence that specific requests were made both those subjects to omit their birth names, and that a consensus decided to comply with those requests, and not that the articles merely omit the names yet because they haven't been developed? Links to discussions, for example? As it stands, two of those articles have only a single, one-line message on their talk pages, and the third has no talk page yet at all, so I'm guessing your don't. Stop pretending that stating something dogmatically makes it true. It doesn't.  

 :::::::""""These BLPs contain information relevant to their subject’s achievements, and that’s what a reputable encyclopedia should focus on."""" We're not talking about what articles focus on. We're talking about whether an biographical article should mention the subject's birth name. Obviously it should, since it's an inherent part of biographical work. Tom Cruise's article certainly focuses on his work and his public image. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't mention his birth surname. What an article should mention and what it should focus on are two different things. Mentioning a subject's birth name and focusing on what he or she is known for are not mutually exclusive points on an Either/Or spectrum. Please stop pretending that they are. 

 :::::::""""The fact that in Touré’s case, the subject made a polite request to have something as irrelevant as a name that is in no way connected to what he has achieved removed rather strengthens that line of reasoning. To make it even clearer, if you were notable, would I want to know whether you were known as Farty Pants in second grade?"""" The fact that Touré made a request to have his name removed strengthens the line of reasoning that encyclopedias should only focus on subject's work? How do you figure this? This is a non sequitur. Do you even know what you're saying? The fact that one of these statements follows the other in your syllogism isn't the same thing as saying that it strengthens it. 

 :::::::Second, the birth name of a subject is not """"irrelevant"""" in a biography about them, and to say that it is preposterous. A person's birth name is one of the first things a biography mentions. Pretending it isn't means you have to ignore just about every biography ever written, and the practices of biographical scholarship itself. By contrast, grade school epithets are irrelevant. Comparing the two is silly. This is an ideological statement, and not one based on biographical practices.  

 :::::::""""Wrt casting aspersions, I merely pointed out a few things that outside observers will find interesting."""" You cast aspersions on other editors by mocking their edit count, and making ad hominem remarks about them, which had nothing to do with this discussion, or with falsifying the reasoning they gave for their positions. The fact that you refer to this with different, euphemistic wording does not change this.

 I've made a new warbox for the war, linking it to the Franco-Dutch War, and linking downwards to two seperate campaigns/subwars, the Scanian offensive (not entirely satisfied with that one, but dont know any better one), and the Gyldenlove war. These two can than be subdivided into the different battles. 
 Of course, we will have to rewrite several parts of the articles, but that shouldnt be too much of a problem. Does this division make some sense?"
d07b0e6995442d78,"""'m interested in a good article, and good content demands verifiability.  In the last discussion I was too perplexed and exhausted from being defensive to seriously or critically assess the result, and to that end I did everyone a disservice.  Those links are not reliable sources, the content is not supported, and it should be removed regardless of who I am.  I think it would make the most sense to set aside preconceptions and really focus on what would make a better article. 

 I think you're right that the article should contain statements about the impact of ear training software on music education.  To that end it is interesting to know that some universities have licensed and require certain applications, and it would be very helpful to show qualitative evidence demonstrating that software does have an influence.  Has that CAI survey been published anywhere?  That's exactly the kind of data that we'd want to reference, but its current presentation violates No Original Research because it has not been published. 

 I am sorry that my edits and edit history make it seem that I am targeting competitors.  This is not the case, and if it is important to you I would be happy to talk about that with you personally (my address is nospam at aruffo dot com).  Publicly I would point out the unfortunate truth that most ear training packages are not notable.  Required use by institutions is an argument for notability; published evidence that a certain ear-training package causes significant improvement would, as a reliable source, justify its mention and inclusion because you are absolutely correct that students who come to this article should be informed of products that will improve their ear.  My complaint is that a product should be verifiably demonstrated to produce improvement before being included here. 

 If a package's only claim for inclusion is that it has unique features, then its inclusion is a statement about that package, not about ear training generally.  Consequently it would be necessary to prove notability.  Links from fifteen different college professors can only support the assertion """"Fifteen college professors are aware that [the package] exists.""""  It cannot support the assertion that a package is notable by WP:NOTE guidelines. 

 Seriously, ultimately I do want to support you.  Our real disagreement in this discussion is about what is worthy enough to be mentioned in an encyclopedia, not whether all """"competitors"""" should be quashed.     

 In addition to what I wrote a little bit ago, let me try here to meet your demand without being defensive.  I apologize for making myself look fickle and arbitrary, as though I were imposing my own will, when the criteria, established by Wiki policy, are unchanging and objective.  I"""

He then filed a separate ANI complaint as a result of me trying to reclose it myself (no action resultedinstead editors there commented that he handled the close incorrectly).

He wrote the following paragraph on page 178 of the book: 

 :::::Many of the myths are simply frivolous and none more so than that suggesting that ever since the conclusion of the Civil War, we have been calling the conflict by the wrong name. During the war it was known by several titles. The North called it the Civil War or the Southern Insurrection or most commonly just the Rebellion, the last two reflecting a definitely regional viewpoint. The Confederates usually called it the war, or occasionally the War for Southern Independence. In the years after the conflict these and other terms were used, and Alexander H. Stevens' 1868 work A Constitutional View of the War Between the States popularized a new name that quickly gained currency in the South. Yet even the majority of former Confederates who wrote about the war in later years in books, memoirs, and letters used the term Civil War, which is commonly used and accepted to this day. 

 ::::All of those who comment on this page have almost certainly seen not just Rebellion but War of the Rebellion used by Northern writers during or not long after the conclusion of the war.

The statements included in the article about Obama being African American stand alone on the few citations. Another example is religious designators which need to be cited once and then the person can be referred throughout the article as Catholic if they are consistent with other policies such as neutrality. It may have happened in the past that people included """"racial designators wherever they thought that it sounds nice"""" and on the face there is nothing inappropriate about this except where it violates other policies.  |

The very limited RCT evidence so far does suggest that this is more effective than e-cigs, but the ceasing consumer doesn't seem to agree, and may be right. Considering all the fuss the question has generated in the US for some years, it's remarkable no one has yet done a proper head to head RCT there - nothing in it for pharma I suppose. On the wider questions, I haven't looked at this section fully yet. Is there a rush?"

888f758bcdff4ffa,"I am new to this so please bear with me. 

 My impetus for adding the article on Bingy Bunny was a function of the difficulties I encountered obtaining this information (for my own needs) after extensive Internet searches.   

 The challenges I ecountered include the following: 

   Alternate spellings of his nickname (an endemic problem in Jamaica) 

   Multiple dates cited for his birth 

   Two (2) dates cited for his death (actually, a 48 hour window  Dec 31 and Jan 1) 

 Granted, his relative obscurity outside of Jamaica and the world of reggae music will likely  fail to meet the level of importance demanded by the editors of wikipedia.org. 

 To me, however, he is a member of a select few Jamaican musicians to have participated during the birth of reggae music.  Due to an unparalled high mortality rate within this group, an astonishingly high number have departed prematurely.  [Fortunately, he witnessed how reggae expanded from its humble birth on his tiny island as it rapidly evolved into a highly influential musical style across the globe.] 

 In any case, would you please help me understand specifically why the automated bot marked it for deletion? 

 Secondly, how might I avoid this problem in the future so that I might refrain from investing the time to create an entry that will likely share a similar fate? 

 Thirdly, is there an archive of this page so that I might access its original contents as I didn't realize at the time that I might need to save a personal copy?

Later still, it was shown that most people with the UGT1A1 mutation ALSO had an even worse mutation in UGT1A7. This explained the results of both the previous studies, and justified the results of the original experiment - that people with GS should avoid acetaminophen (Tylenol).

 :*democide against the Greeks...genocide...347,000 dead[2]

 :*compared experience to the Holocaust[4] 
 :*series of massacres, pertinent to the Armenian Genocide[5] 
 :*ethnic cleansing[6] 
 :*...So is the Turkish Consul General [alive and well], now complaining to the university administration that the Center of Comparative Genocide Studies, which I direct, has (unfairly?, unwisely?) allowed the Greek community to fund a research unit devoted to the genocide of the Pontian Greeks, by the Turks, after World War I. The Center, founded by me at the end of 1993, has its somewhat clumsy title because the senior professor above, the one who wanted """"balance"""", was a little anxious at the University Council meeting, which has the power to establish Centers, that plain """"Genocide Studies"""" would be a little unbalanced -""""You know, a little too, ah, you know..."""" We know. There is of course, a very strong case for the visibility of """"comparative"""": it allows us to develop a model of gradiations of genocide, to avoid the obvious trap of flattening all genocides, of allowing scholars to get away with blatant misuse of the term when they seek to highlight a wrong by reaching for the ultimate cannon in the armory.''[7] (note: which HE directs has allowed, and also note how nice he puts it for all deniers)

edd3754fd9adf7bb,"""I read the link.  It says nothing to indicate that this was the first time any one knew he had the symptoms, only that it was news to CNN.  I think it took the MSM close to ten years to """"discover"""" the U.N. oil for food scandal.  The date in which an event is reported is not necessarily the date it occurred.  I wish there were some more dates given; those are always helpful for establishing timelines.  You may be right, that Moore didn't know about Heston's condition before the interview, but unfortunately your source doesn't seems to give us the specific information necessary to even suggest it.  And what is clear, and much more important, is Heston's obvious senility in the film.  If Moore didn't know beforehand, he most certainly must have realised it then.  That was certainly my reaction.  When I first saw the film, I didn't know anything about Moore, and very little about Heston.  Nevertheless, it was excruciatingly clear that Heston suffered from some mental debilitation (I assumed general senility at the time) and lacked the mental capacity to respond.  It was equally clear the Moore aimed to take advantage of this for personal gain. 

 Since you appear to take an objective stance on that portion of the film, try this:  Roughly 1 hour and 48 minutes into the film (this might vary with different copies of the film), moore asks to interview Heston, he is told to show up the next day at 8:30AM.  About 3 minutes and twenty seconds later, a clock clearly shows 6:03.  No reason for this discrepancy is given.  Indeed, if you rewind a little bit further from that position, you will see the clock (showing only the minute hand) pointing about a minute above the 9.  Thus, about 5:46 (possibly an hour or more earlier, but this seems unlikely)  When Heston leaves, the clock can be seen again stating the time to be 6:10.  Moore edited down a 24 minute interview into just a few minutes and the time given that the interview was supposed to have occurred was contradicted within the film.  I suppose that's not much of a big deal, only circumstantial evidence on its own.  What is more important is Hestons OBVIOUS demeanor.  He demonstrates an OBVIOUS lack of the complete mental capacity needed to answer such rapid fire loaded questions, and the filmmaker has edited down the piece a great deal, depriving us of much information that occurred in the interview. 

 Micheal asks a myriad of loaded questions.  For example, """"Why do you go to these places (to have gun rallies) after these horrible tragedies?""""  NRA meetings are held annually and of a pre-determined time and location.  Moore must've known this, as he is a member.  Heston must've too, but was unable to respond. 

 I had not meant for this conversation to become about a scene within a different Moore film.  If anyone is willing to respond to even one of the blatant deceptions I pointed out (in this film) with some sort of reasonable response, we can continue (begin?) to discuss the issue.

 First off, I'm sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you. The block in question was slated to expire in about two or three hours from the time of this reply, but I've lifted it in any case  if nothing else, the symbology of doing so is important. 

 If it's any consolation, I was not """"drunk with power,"""" but was struggling to deal with a very persistent and abusive user who was stalking valuable editors and vandalizing a wide number of articles (more than could be practically protected from editing, another available tool). I've been a user at Wikipedia for some time, and an administrator for several months, but this is the first time I've dealt with these particular issues on such a scale or intensity. Seemingly credible death and rape threats were being issued not only against a particular user, but also against their family members. The only apparently viable options were for the victim user to stop editing Wikipedia, or for a strong action to deter the troll from further abuse. 

 Before you ask, I did check, and Sympatico is not apparently known for their responsiveness to abuse reports. Very few ISPs are; that's unfortunate for situations such as this, because it might be the best way to actually deal with these sorts of problems. 

 In any case, I tried a brief rangeblock, at first. The block was set only to block anonymous users, and included simple instructions to register an account an evade the block. When that didn't work, I opted to try a longer one, three days, which is what you ran into. 

 It's difficult to know ahead of time how much collateral damage such a block will cause. I truly do hate to think that even one person will have to suffer for the unfortunate actions of one abusive user, and in this case the damage was more than I was willing to tolerate. I've lifted the block, and will strive to avoid such actions in the future. 

 Unlike the apparently faceless admins at many sites, I've found that most enwiki admins are responsive to queries and really do care what their """"customers"""" think. In my case, I'm only human; I have troubles, I get busy or overwhelmed. I do the best I can, but it is inevitable that any person will make mistakes. Chalk it down as a lesson learned. 

 The block should be removed at this time; if you have any problems editing, feel free to contact me or the unblock-en-l mailing list (you'll see instructions for doing so in the event you're blocked). 

 Thanks for your time and consideration.  """

 'Dr. Pielke asked to be put in and provided a quote for me to use. Here it is: 

 “Humans are significantly altering the global climate, but in a variety of diverse ways beyond the radiative effect of carbon dioxide. The IPCC assessments have been too conservative in recognizing the importance of these human climate forcings as they alter regional and global climate. These assessments have also not communicated the inability of the models to accurately forecast the spread of possibilities of future climate. The forecasts, therefore, do not provide any skill in quantifying the impact of different mitigation strategies on the actual climate response that would occur.”

 ::::Thanks for that answer, during which I was already typing. So firstly, to respond specifically to your last-but-one post above: 
 I mean the probability of choosing a goat or the car from the contestant's perspective. 
 I am distinguishing deliberately revealing a goat from other host behaviors because the contestant can infer the former (by the information that he knows what's behind the doors being superfluous if he is random) while the latter cannot be inferred from the information given. 
 Randomly revealing a goat would look no different, but the contestant has the information to infer it is not random on this occasion. 
 The Bayesian may calculate (not guess) 2/3, as the set of all possible unstated hindering variant behaviors and the set of helpful ones are equal in likelihood and opposite in value, thus neutral to the solution. Although I think the absence of any positive information means the assumption of 'no motive' is a safe one. 
 The frequentist answering the MHP question (ie 'In the circumstances stated in this scenario, is it to your advantage to switch?') would only count those games where the MHP circumstances apply, and their solution would approach 2/3.  
 As to the specific sources, making the same conditions is not the same as using the word 'always' - the precise conditions might only occur once in a series of similar games, or even once in all time, with the result on that occasion still 2/3. 
 I should emphasise that while variant scenarios may occur without affecting the MHP when it occurs, if variant host behavior can be discerned by the contestant a game meeting all the other conditions cannot be the MHP; as vos Savant put it """"Anything else is a different question"""". 
 Regarding your most recent post, I get basic conditional probability though am a novice in math and stats. The first time the MHP ever occurred the probability was 2/3. If it never occurred again, it was still 2/3. Now every time those conditions come together it's 2/3. If the host revealed the car on yesterday's show but you don't know why, it's 2/3 if the MHP comes together today. I am not disagreeing with the assumptions, or that they 'must' accompany the MHP, just with the word 'always'.  """

Stating that you are lol'ing (^^) means you are practically falling off your chair where as griner/*g*/*gg* is just common laughing. 
    
 :also gg means good game, faggots 

 == Please delete the article. == 

 Don't delete it (It is a part of modern culture as much as many other things are), but please, the entire first section of the article is garbage. At least create a new section about all of these """"studies"""" or better yet, delete them and replace it with a history of the word. Seriously, though, the first section has to go. 
    

 lol is laugh out loud and lmao is laugh my ass off  As much as the acronym 'LOL' is in global use, it belongs more on Urban Dictionary than a fully-featured encyclopedia. Please delete the article or at least get somebody else to do it as it is quite pathetic with details. They're not wrong, just a little bit inaccurate and the article is very unprofessional. It's already been nominated for deletion once; keep Wikipedia to the informal articles, please.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 And why isn't an acronym encyclopedic?   

 Fully-featured minus """"LOL""""? How is the article """"quite pathetic with the details""""? Did you request the deletion just for teh lullz?      

 (LOL also means Lots Of Love)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 :Also, the previous discussion resulted in Speedy Keep.    

 """"LOL is a common element of Internet slang used historically on Usenet"""". Do we really need to use the word USENET?    

 == ROFFLES == 
 ROFFLES redirects here, but the article doesn't mention it once.  Can't figure out what the extra letters mean.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     
 Do we even need this article?    

 Internet lingo is immature, and stupid. It's hardly worthy of an article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 This article falls completely within the requirements of Wikipedia articles per Wikipedia standards. It, however, does require work to become a more complete and constructive encyclopedic entry.  As noted above all previous attempts to have this article deleted have resulted in a """"speedy keep"""" verdict.  It may be prudent to discuss a merge of this article into common internet lingo if there is enough of objection to LOL being a separate article, but this move would have to be discussed at length and would not be an overnight outcome.  January 1, 2009 6:59PM 

 Could someone please delete the line """"Teenagers now sometimes use them in spoken communication as well as in written, with ROFL (pronounced /ˈroʊfəl/ or /ˈrɒfəl/) and LOL (pronounced /ˈloʊl/, /ˈlɒl/, or /ˌɛloʊˈɛl/), for example""""?

 ==A Problem in the US Only== 
 This whole thing is a problem in the US only and should be pointed out as such. No other culture lacks the social skills of people in the US. The shame of course is they pick a 'solution' that's so typical of them - and actually further propagates their own silliness. A little commentary on how pathetic the whole thing is would not be inappropriate and would only be opposed by stunted males from the US still acting like cowardly preteens. Put this article - if indeed it need stay here when so many really important things are systematically and wantonly deleted - in its proper context. And what would women and feminists say if they saw this rubbish? Thank you.18:33, 12 February 2011"

 Anyhow, I hate to bother the top brass, but the Schiavo article is a Featured Article Candidate, and, while some of the critics have good points about image copyright concerns, most of the other criticisms are unfounded (e.g., length of article must be long to """"do justice,"""" etc.), I think the article is stable and very well-written.

 The problem may be stated simply: what are the """"rights"""" in civil rights? Unless you define your terms, your use of those terms will be problematic. As it currently exists, the opening paragraph makes interesting reading. It asserts that civil rights are enforced by governments. This implies that the rights are therefore somehow created by governments and foisted on to the people. This cannot be right (usage intended to make the point). In philosophical terms, the rights already exist independently of the legal system and, when their existence becomes controversial, some of them are formalised into laws (frequently being distorted in a partisan process). Hence, I think the entire page should be rewritten from scratch to remove unjustified assumptions and assertions, and to establish a conceptual framework within which specific examples can be considered. For example, would a use of power to remove or restrict an adult's right to freely associate with another be an infringement of that person's civil rights? Would discriminatory treatment on the ground of nationality, political views. race, religion, gender, disability, etc, all properly be considered within the framework? If so, what is the common denominator as between, say, preventing a transgender person from going through a marriage ceremony and preventing a Christian from interfering in the teaching of science? Without a conceptual framework, the inclusion of any issue you might select will be arbitrary and potentially offend sensibilities because you have not established a neutral POV."""

 It's a fact that there are more romanians than the statistics will ever say. I happen to belive that maybe there are more than 8 million romanians abroad.

The issue, as Izno has pointed out again, is simply finding a reasonable number of reliable sources on Freerunning. So far I know of only Sebastien's book, Sebastien's radio interview and Julie Angel's 'Cine parkour' thesis, however there may be some we can salvage from the old Freerunning page. I think the best thing we can do for now is to find more sources on Freerunning. 
 ::There is a lot of media related to Tim Shieff and Daniel Ilabaca so I think we should be able to find sources on their views relatively easily, however I don't consider them to be experts. There is a difference between someone who is good at moving and someone who has a good understanding the discipline as a whole, and they are the former rather than the latter. This difference isn't often appreciated by the media that is focused on spectacle, but we need to be careful when we use their views in an article here. We can use them for sources on the views of freerunners, but we need to word things carefully to avoid confusing facts with opinions. There may be some things we can use from that Fight Science episode, but there is also a lot of nonsense so we need to be careful there too.

 == """"Because""""? == 

 The section Holy See-Israel relations#Zionism, Israel & the Holy See before and after 1993#Paul VI contains the following statement: """"Because the majority of Christians in Arab countries were Arabs, he voiced mild criticism of the Israeli policy towards the Palestinians"""". This statement seems to imply that Paul VI was concerned about the Palestinians only because a lot of Arabs were Catholics. By doing so, the statement simultaneously casts doubt on Paul VI's integrity and denigrates the legitimacy of Palestinian grievances. I'm sure that the statement's author didn't intend to do either of those things, but I think that the clause """"Because the majority of Christians in Arab countries were Arabs"""" should be removed.

It's giving a cheap victory to the small minority of Wikipedia members who want to use Wikipedia as a megaphone for their own sociopolitical agenda without any sort of consensus on the part of the whole community. 

 And that is why we should revert the title to """"Heaven's Gate (cult).""""

 == Why is this article not called """"Republic of China""""? == 

 In the Macedonia name dispute a vote was taken that ignored the provisional UN name of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The rationale given for this is that Wikipedia does not conform to international bodies and that self-determination of name trumps regardless of international disputes between states. Ergo - why are the people of the Republic of China held to a different standard? This inconsistent logic smells of prejudice towards either  the people of Taiwan and/or the people of Greece. I therefore propose that this article be renamed Republic of China to keep things consistent.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

  
 A few points I'd like to add. 

 # The People's Republic of China recognizes the self-determined name of Republic of Macedonia. 
 # The People's Republic of China does not recognize the self-determination of the Republic of China (Taiwan). 
 # The US government, did not recognize Republic of Macedonia in 1944 (the US state department at the time calling it """"communist demagoguery"""") but flip flopped in 2003 and now recognizes it. 
 # The US government, orginally did recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan)  right up until it flip-flopped and removed recognition in the 1970s. 

 This opens up the secondary question is Wikipedia taking a principled approach on international issues or simply parroting the current foreign policy of leading nations? (i.e. mob rule)  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 : For the reasons given here: Talk:Taiwan/Archive 20. A lot of discussion so a lot of reading, but if you're interested in the issue I think well worth reading at least the highlights of it.  

 :: For the same reason that we have North Korea not the 'Democratic People Republic of Korea' and we have Burma not the 'Republic of the Union of Myanmar'. It is policy to use the common English name. Not the official name; not the UN designated name; not the preferred name of the local people; but the common name as used by English speaking people to describe the subject. See WP:Naming Conventions for more information about how article names are decided on Wikipedia.    

 ::: Naming this article 'Taiwan' does not contribute clarity. Titling the article 'Taiwan' may lead the reader to belief that such a country as 'Taiwan' exists, or that 'Taiwan' can be equated to the 'Republic of China', which are both invalid arguments in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China. The fact is that no country called 'Taiwan' exists, and that the 'Republic of China' cannot be casually associated with 'Taiwan' as historically they are very distinct entities. It also contravenes the rules for Wikipedia's neutral POV rules, as it promotes the DPP's assertion that Taiwan should edge toward independence by increasing the usage of 'Taiwan' without officially abandoning the 'Republic of China' name. It is for the sake of objectiveness that the official name should be used. See: WP:Neutral point of view   
 ::::Again see the requested move, where this was debated in long detail to arrive at the current title, best representing consensus and common usage. The article is Taiwan reflecting the common name for the country.  

 :::::Thank you  for your clarification on this matter. I agree that this article should be named Taiwan for the sake of clarity to English speakers in Wikipedia. However, I believe that it should be made clearer that the Republic of China is not equivalent to Taiwan.

404c023bbe3ebfe1,"== MSU Interview == 

 Dear MGodwin, 

 My name is Jonathan Obar , I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the communityHERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students. 

  
 So a few things about the interviews: 
 * Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes. 
 * Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.) 
 * All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so. 
 * All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time. 
 * The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly. 

  
 Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name instead. 

 If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you. 

 Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you. 

 Sincerely, 

 Jonathan Obar"

 YOU SAY: 

 1. Full accord between SSPX and the Holy See is lacking. To put it more positively, there is a dispute. When presenting in 1993 the revised Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism, and so of relations with other Christian denominations, Cardinal Edward Cassidy said what is obvious, namely that the dispute with SSPX, as with other Catholics of whatever tendency, is an internal matter of the Catholic Church, not a matter of ecumenical relations. He did not say there was no dispute. Surely nobody seriously believes there is no dispute, no lack of full accord. 

 I RESPOND: 

 No one says there is no dispute between the SSPX/other traditional Catholics and some Vatican hierarchs. But """"accord"""" is much too vague to use here, as is """"Holy See."""" Is Cardinal Mahony """"in full accord"""" with """"the Holy See""""? What about Bishop Malone of Liverpool  made Bishop by """"John Paul the Great"""" in 1989  who wants women (who, by definition, cannot become priests, see JPII's Mulieris Dignitatem and look at what the Church has always taught) to hear Confessions and grant absolution (which, according to Catholic dogma, only priests can do? (see http://www.cathnews.com/news/308/164.php )  

 What about Cardinal O'Brien who used a Mass of thanksgiving as an occasion to question Church teaching and discipline regarding contraception, homosexuality, and clerical celibacy? (see http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=25029) 

 What about Cardinal Kasper, who denies that Jews need Jesus to be saved and who denies the Catholic understanding of apostolic succession? (see http://www.thetablet.co.uk/cgi-bin/archive_db.cgi?tablet-00742 ) 

 Then there's Bishop Lucas of Springfield, who held his ordination party in a Masonic Lodge. JPII made him Bishop in 1999, when someone had to replace Bishop Ryan, who was caught with his cassock down around priests and male prostitutes (JPII made him Bishop in 1981).  

 What about Bishops Zipfel and Aquila of North Dakota, both appointed to their Sees by JPII, who refused to endorse a bill to criminalize abortion? 

 Now, what does it mean for a Catholic to be """"in full accord"""" with this sort of thing? 

 YOU SAY: 

 2. I wrote of """"the teachings"""" of the Second Vatican Council, not """"some of the teachings"""". Nor did I write: """"infallible teachings"""".  

 I RESPOND: 
 But what teachings  fallible or infallible  """"of the Second Vatican Council"""" do """"traditional Catholics"""" have to accept lest they put themselves """"outside the Church"""" or """"not in full accord"""" with """"Rome""""? (and wouldn't it be much better for the Church if """"conservative Catholics"""" stopped picking on """"trads"""" and focused on those who deny Catholic dogma? Why go after """"trads"""" when Sr. Chittisters are running around promoting homosexuality, and the typical Catholic you run into has no problem with the """"ordination"""" of women? If all the energy spent going after """"trads"""" were focused on 1) learning what """"traditional Catholics"""" ACTUALLY think, and 2) evangelizing, and 3) fighting Modernism  well, what a better world it would be.) (as to Modernism, see the oath against it here: http://www.kensmen.com/catholic/sacrorum.html ) 

 YOU SAY: 

 I also wrote of """"the subsequent decrees of the Holy See. (""""Subsequent"""" means """"that FOLLOWED"""".) I am still waiting for a clear understandable definition by Anonymous of what he understands by """"traditional Catholic"""". 

 I RESPOND: 

 I think I've explained it very clearly. A """"traditional Catholic"""" is a Catholic who wants to preserve (or restore where wanting) the traditional Mass, traditional Sacramental rites, and ALL of the teachings of the Church AS they have always been understood by the Church. What are the differences in how mainstream Catholics and traditional Catholics understand those eternal teachings of the Church? See the hideously-named section four of the article as it stands now at 1 October 2005, 1:15 AM EST. It is quite clear. It is laid out. The encyclicals are explicitly named (As a fellow Catholic, I beg you to read them). The issues are described. The section could be beefed up, but there it is. Those are the issues. 

 The term """"traditional Catholic"""" doesn't indicate a mere preference for the traditional Mass or else you'd have to count as a """"traditional Catholic"""" people like Andrew Sullivan and anyone who just likes Latin or Palestrina or incense and has any aesthetic taste at all.  

 It doesn't mean one must, in fact, attend a traditional Mass or else you'd have to exclude anyone who believes what was just outlined, but who doesn't have access to a traditional Mass (whether this person attends a N.O.  which a """"traditional Catholic"""" may or may not consider valid  in the meantime or not).

 == A suggestion. == 

 In the section entitled """"Formation"""", the phrase """"the group has been accused of being islamophoic"""" appears. I suggest that this phrase, which,  being the first to mention islamophobia, is of some importance to the article, be relocated to the opening section. My reasons for making this suggestion are thus: 

 * The information, as written, has no connexion to the subject of the section, which is the group's formation. 

 * The theme of islamophobia is prevalent enough in the article, to warrant a mention in the opening section. 

 * The phrase, as written, is very awkwardly inserted and has the appearance of an afterthought. A superior passage might read """"Due to the nature of its activities/past statements &c.;, the group has been accused of Islamophobia. At this time, it bears the stamp of bias, stylistically if not thematically (i.e, as if some person, wishing to insert material relating to Islamophobia, but not being committed to inserting the said material in an elegant or encyclopaedic manner, simply tacked it onto the end of the paragraph). 

 Therefore, I reiterate my desire to relocate the phrase, or have it rewritten. Ordinarily, I should do this without consultation, as it is a trifle, but those with vested interests (masquerading as moral obligations or otherwise), have often used pages such as this as battlegrounds (try relocating a comma on Hitler's page!).

In such meanings, it can be mildly offensive, but is most often jocose. The verb alcovitar translates roughly as """"to pander"""" (to facilitate courtship or sexual relations), so alcoviteiro also translates as the most polite Portuguese word for English """"pimp"""", so it is likely to be regarded as something of very poor taste calling someone by this term if the person in question has no minimal intimacy with the other to be good-tempered with obscene jokes.""""

d55402b3f509155d,"Personal view: I agree that Asuka is a proud, strong individual. Her goal is to succeed. As the story goes she graduated from college/university at an early age and was excited to join the EVA project. She has tried to mature very fast, although at the age of 14 this is surely a huge strain. Her brave efforts to succeed are constantly grounded by Shinji, who unwittingly has a 'natural talent' for piloting EVA 01. However hard Asuka tries, Shinji always seems to be better then her. Eventually this drives Asuka into making a foolish attack on the fifteenth Angel Arael which in turn mentally rapes her, leaving Asuka almost comatosed.  
 Prior to this Asuka is a strong, sociable, likeable character and as with many characters in the story, you find your self sadenned by the terrible events that unfold around such promising ability.

b9e0cfa68863787d,""" 

 ==Byte size== 

 http://www.answers.com/topic/byte - answers.com gives good definition of byte. (or http://www.yourdictionary.com/byte). 

 So, real definition of byte is that it is a """"basic unit of digital computer"""". On PC, this basic unit is 8 nowadays, but it used to be 7. Byte is unit, in which files or other data is measured on that specific computer - of course, you can simulate different data types anywhere, but on PC, most hardware data (except flags, which are still usually contained in 8^n bit tuples) is kept in memory area, which is n*8 bits, where n is integer. In cases when data is kept in smaller units, it is called """"compressed"""" - and one piece of compressed units in assembly is usually still contained in 8*n memory area, at least when manipulated with assembler's base commands. 

 So, saying that 1KB must be 1000 bytes is correct, but measuring hardware sizes in bytes is correct only as long as you are using computer, which uses 8-bit characters. When utf-8 becomes more widespread, it's possible that 32-bit bytes will be used instead and this makes KB 4 times larger. So, KB is system-specific notation. Saying that byte is 8 bits would be as good as saying that word is 32 bits (or worse, that integers are 32 bits) - words have been both 16 and 32 bits depending if archidecture is 16 or 32 bits; on 64-bits archidecture it might happen that many languages start to refer 64-bit integers as """"words"""". So, """"word"""" simply means some datatype, which is native enough to do calculations on computer; byte mostly means smallest size of non-empty file or system-managed memory area.  """

 == Mk.I mistake == 
 the photos that represent WWI have a photo of a Mk.IV but it is said that it is a Mk.I, it is not a Mk.I because it lacks the wooden wheel, granade roof, camo and has diffrent drivers cab and sponsons 

 == The Treaty of Versailles Didn't Cause WWI, it ended it. == 

 """"The 'War Guilt' of Germany"""" subsection talks about the WWI armistice treaty and the war debt Germany had to pay after WWI.  It was under the """"Causes"""" section.  Things that happened after a war are not a cause of the war, so I moved """"The 'War Guilt' of Germany"""" subsection from the """"Causes"""" of WWI section to the """"Aftermath"""" section.   flagged my move of this content as a deletion and a vandalism and moved the post-treaty aftermath content back to one of the causes of WWI. Dumbass.  

 :OK, I misread the diffs, because you made the change in 2 stages it looked as if you had removed content.  So you weren't vandalising, however, I think you've misunderstood what was being said.  The treaty of Versaille established the """"offical"""" cause of the war as being German aggression, hence the war guilt section being there.  Please avoid personal insults, here and on my talk page (see WP:CIVIL) and add comments at the bottom of the page and sign them (see WP:TALK).

 :Fixed. Thanks for your suggestion!   

 ==Entente or Allied?== 

 Let's pick one or the other to prevent confusing people (right now thay are both used). I suggest Allies, because that is more common, but it's up to you guys. 
 ::yes Allies works better.  

 never even heard the phrase """"entente"""" before - Jedi of Redwll 

 Entente is most properly the name of the alliances BEFORE the war (I believe) and Allies takes up after war is declared. - JEK   

 deleted 

 ===Disagree=== 

 If anything, the term """"Alliance"""" should refer to the Central Powers, since they grew out of the Triple Alliance, as opposed to the victorious powers growing out of the Triple Entente.  Admittedly, that did not include the US, but the US entered the war expressly not as an ally of the T.E., but rather because of German violations of US shipping. 

 I think it's also a little POV.  The reference seems to come from the common tendency to view WWI through the prism of WWII, after which the term 'Ally' took on a positive connotation it didn't have in the 1910s (at least in the US). 

 I'll give a week for comment, and then if I find the appropriate reference, I'll make some edits. 

 

 The official terms used are """"Triple Entente"""" and """"Triple Alliance"""" - there is no real side at that point that is named the Allies because both sides are really just allies grouped up. The term """"Allies"""" was only used in WWII and like said, if anything """"Allies"""" should be used to describe the Central Powers though in my opinion it should not be used to describe either if for no reason but to avoid confusion. 

 I have noticed that the term """"Allies"""" is generally used to mean the countries allied with Britain, not the USA. For example, in the Napoleonic Wars, the Allies were at various times Britain, the French Royalists, Spain, Prussia, Russia, Austria, etc., while the USA was on the side of Imperial France. In WWI allies was only used in the literal sense, and in WWII, the Allies were of course the USA, UK, USSR, etc,. In other wars the term Allies is usually used for the larger side.   
 ::interesting point. Note that the US was NOT allied with Napoleonic France in the war of 1812.    
 == AEF and the allies wish. == 

 Hi, I have to disagree with this statement

 == External link to photos of students watching assassination news == 

 The topic is JFK. The link I was posting was to photographs of high school students in a small Midwestern town watching the assassination news on a TV that had been pulled into the school gym. It was taken by a high school kid (me) who rushed the photo to the local paper in time to make an EXTRA edition. I think it adds a dimension to the JFK story because it shows the impact of the shooting on a generation that had just lost its innocence. It is relevant enough to the topic that it has been requested by national media for their upcoming specials.

b4af0fe1370b418e,"""Introduction Suggestion == 

 The introduction, second paragraph, begins: """" The main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.""""  Then, however, in the following sentence it reads: """" Most scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that Jesus was…"""".  First, the use of a weasel word in the second paragraph is foreboding for the entire article.  Second, the opinions of scholars might best be discussed below the introduction considering the divisive topic.  Instead, I propose that the second sentence merely follow from the first, providing a summary of who Jesus was according to the four sources mentioned.  Any later treatment of Jesus will have to take up this presentation, even if to just dismiss it, before continuing discussion.  Thus the purpose of the introduction would be fulfilled, and scholarly opinion can be dealt with more specifically later on.    

 :The introduction is supposed to summarize the article. A large portion of the article is the Historicity or scholarly views section. A summary of that section, to some extent, needs to be in the intro. That said, each and every sentence in the introduction has been over with a fine tooth comb. Voting and debating and consensus was involved in their creation. I suggest digging through the archives and subpages to learn more about the process on how we arrived at those decisions. A new perspective is always good, and suggestions are welcome, but if you want to know more about the background of those sentences, there is always the archive.  

 :Oh, please, no! To rephrase Dorothy, templates and pictures and intros, OH MY! Even without that, combining the sentences would be a poor edit, since they deal with two separate issues: what people use as the major sources of info, and what scholars believe based on the Gospels and a plethora of other sources like the apocrypha and records from surrounding (and often conquering) cultures. I so very strongly recommend that we don't poke that particular bear.

 ==Japanese Surrender== 

 Did the Japanese surrender unconditionally?  

 the potsdam decleration said  
 :There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world. 
 But the surrender documents did not go that far. The surrender documents specifically the """"INSTRUMENT OF SURRENDER"""" states that like the German Armed forces the Japanes armed forces surrendered unconditionally """"unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and of all Japanese armed forces and all armed forces under the Japanese control wherever situated"""" But unlike the German State which was subject to the Four Powers Agreement: 
 :The Governments of the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom, and the Provisional Government of the French Republic, hereby assume supreme authority with respect to Germany, including all the powers possessed by the German Government, the High Command and any state, municipal, or local government or authority. 

 In the case of the Japanese surrender document it states:  
 :The authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers who will take such steps as he deems proper to ef- fectuate these terms of surrender. 
 It does not say that the Allied powers  
 :assume supreme authority with respect to Japan, including all the powers possessed by the Japanese Government, the High Command and any state, municipal, or local government or authority.  
 So it was an an unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces but a conditional surrender of the Japanese government. The Japanese Emperor remaind the Emperor.     """

Of the Commonwealth Realms, currently Australia, Barbados, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines do not list a royal anthem in the infobox.  Non-Commonwealth Realm monarchies that do have a royal anthem in the infobox include Sweden, Norway, and perhaps Spain - the national anthem is Marcha Real, or Royal March.

 I just wanted to say briefly that, no matter what the Wikipedia article says, or any RS, I lived there for decades. If you direct that word at a woman in many areas of the country, you can kiss goodbye to your teeth. And for a lot of women, it's not only an insulting word to hear from a man, but a threatening one, because it's likely to be the word you hear just before being punched or raped. 

 That doesn't mean that no one ever uses it as a form of endearment, by the way: I have seen that argument, and of course that could apply to any word. I'm talking about its use between people who don't know each other.

 == Edit request dated 2nd October on the """"Kiss"""" Talk page == 

 Hi Hitsuji Kinno! 

 I’m the person who made the edit request regarding the Indian “origins” of kissing on the 2nd of October 2013, which Stfg saw to on the 6th of the same month. 

 I’ve had reason to check up on this page and these kind of things in general on Wikipedia. If you go to the Talk page of the Wikipedia article “Man”, you’ll be able to read all about it. Let me give it to you in short. There is a group (a large one at that) of Indians who indulge in boosterism (as I’ve learnt to call it) on the net in general and Wikipedia in particular. The idea is solely to claim India as the origin of a whole gamut of things without any real scholarship at all to back those claims or very poor scholarship (when there is ambiguity). Furthermore, they will not argue rationally and will literally stop at nothing to propagate what they wish to be known to the world at large. 

 Now, let’s get to the “kiss” issue. Citation No. 5, which was in the article when I’d made the request, did not mention the Vedas. Citation No. 6 on the present page does mention what you say. Firstly, the West in general misunderstands India, and what is not understood too well is often glorified. Traditional Indians don’t know when to begin dating their texts; they were either there right from the beginning of the universe (I’m not kidding!) or date to some hoary antiquity which you and I can’t imagine. The discovery of the Indus Valley Civilization brought western historians to about the date 1500 BC for the composition of the Rig Veda (and hence the start of the Aryan period in India). It is acknowledged that the last of the four Vedas, the Atharva Veda, was composed in about 1000 BC, the Yajur Veda about 1200 BC and the Sama Veda somewhere between the Rig Veda and the Yajur Veda. It is also universally accepted that the four Vedas were composed before any of the other (numerous) works. The impression that the line you have quoted gives is that there were four texts from 1500 BC which talk about kissing. Even if I am wrong here, the fact remains that Citation No. 6 does not give any lines from the texts which would verify this. I have read parts of the Rig Veda and I did come across a few lines exhorting men and women to copulate in the sunshine (or something like that, if I remember correctly), but nothing about kissing per se. The lines from the Song of Solomon have been quoted in the Wikipedia article and the sources are genuine sources (one primary and the other a published secondary one). Surely Citation No. 6 cannot be taken seriously. It’s basically another ten-slide affair, with no citations of its own. Correct me if I’m wrong, but this is not the kind of citation which Wikipedia should have to offer the general public. 

 It’s also a matter of commonsense and rationality, if you really think about it. Kissing would rank, in my opinion, along with some other human achievements (like language, agriculture, etc.) which could be called basic/natural, in that it would be absurd to try to trace them to a single common source. These things developed in different places along different lines and at different times. It seems ridiculous to state that the Greeks and Romans had to wait till they heard of kissing from India. (Ovid's """"Art of Love"""" predates the Kamasutra by at least two centuries!) And what about the Egyptians, who have an attested history going back to 3000 BC and who gave us the modern romantic notion of the wedding ring? Also, given that (i) the use of the mouth to taste, and (ii) the fact that the genitals in human beings are so located that intercourse would naturally lead to licking, sucking and kissing are both biological notions that are probably as old as the human race, wouldn’t it again be ludicrous to think that only a mere two to three millenia ago (which is 0.1% of the history of the human race as we know it today), people started to kiss, and that too in one geographical location? India, Greece, Ancient Rome and Egypt are all either tropical countries or close enough to the tropics. It would make more sense that peoples living in frigid conditions (like the Eskimos) would have felt the need to indulge in kissing out of sheer necessity (both as a means of increasing body warmth and as a reminder that one is not alone in a harsh Arctic land).  

 Basically, one should be careful in today’s internet world, where everybody has a lot to say but very, very little of it is of any worth. I repeat: 1) I believe that the claims do not hold water; 2) The purported “lines” from the texts are neither quoted nor are the “source citations” convincing to any degree; 3) I believe that this is part of Indian boosterism, either by Indians themselves or non-Indians who don't really know much about India.

No. No reliable source would ever print such a baseless statement ... wait a minute, they did and at least the fascist claim is already cited here (currently 144). I hope this makes it quite clear that repeating idiotic and factually baseless claims on Wikipedia is just plain stupid and should be avoided. We are not here to distribute gossip. And it doesn't matter if some high-profile writer says something stupid it is still stupid. And before writing such nonsense we Wikipedians should wait until such claims are reasonably explained. Until then we can only report that gamergaters claim ethics, a lot of writers for various outlets claim harassment and nobody is the wiser. The statistics I have seen so far have been interpreted both ways by third-parties. I'd say, wait a year or so and then rewrite history, er, the article.

9a9a6fdfb5a9b124,"==This article needs expansion== 
 ...And I propose to do this, using (along with some minor ones) several ru_language sources. In its current state the article is almost totally unsourced, but there’d be no problem in incorporating almost everything that’s already in there into the new, sourced/expanded version. There are some exceptions, though. The following assertions, to my mind, have to be either re-written or dropped altogether, unless some sound arguments are put forward in their defense:  
 * According to tradition, soon after his birth some discord between Lermontov's father and grandmother erupted... - What kind of tradition that is? 
 * As a small boy Lermontov listened to stories about the outlaws of the Volga region, about their great bravery and wild country life. - Well-documented are (later) Lermontov's complaints of having heard too little of Russian folklore in his childhood, being fed mostly with the German fairytales, from his governess Rehmer. Anyway, sourcing wanted.  
 * in 1828, he entered the gymnasium... - That was the Moscow University's elitist boarding school for the nobility children. In 2 years time it was transformed into an (ordinary) gymnasium, and that was exactly what prompted Lermontov's departure. 
 * ...one of his friends, Katerina Khvostovaya... - Khvostova, actually, - but only later, in marriage. She is better known as Yekaterina Sushkova. 
 * A prank pulled by a group of students against one of the professors named Malov brought his time at the University to an end. Several biographers cite this incident as the reason for Mikhail's departure. - At least 4 of my sources tell me otherwise: the Malov incident had no bearing upon Lermontov’s decision to leave the University whatsoever. Participate he did, but hasn’t received any punishment - unlike, say, Hertzen, who's got incarcerated. The 5th source, Mirsky, fails to mention the Malov incident at all.  
 * Young cadet - first poems (section). Dates are wrong. The At that time he began writing poetry... assertion - even more so. He started writing poetry way back in 1827.  
 * Works (section). Lermontov's poetic development was unusual. His earliest unpublished poems that he circulated in manuscript through his friends in the military were pornographic in the extreme, with elements of sadism. - Again, those were not his earliest poems; he started very early and in the University was quite prolific. If his poetic development was indeed strange, then for totally different reasons, but that would be another story. His 'frivolous' verses deserve a mention, but hardly more than that. Some have termed Lermontov's early verse puerile, since, despite his dexterous command of the language, it usually appeals more to adolescents than to adults. - Debatable; needs to be sourced. Besides, what about the earlier 'pornographic in the extreme, with elements of sadism' bid?) 
 * His short poems range from indignantly patriotic pieces... to the pantheistic glorification of living nature... - Looks for me like too narrow a scope. There was some philosophical/metaphysical depth to most of them, too. Besides, along with ‘indignantly patriotic pieces’ there were ‘indignantly unpatriotic’, politically highly provocative ones.  
 Before getting on to the 'Works', though, I'd rather deal with the 'Private Life' sec. -"

 Hi everyone, 

 I have begun expanding the information on the Laws to make the game more understandable to those who don't know much about the game (this is an encyclopaedia after all): prior to this there was very little about how the game is actually played. I have tried to cover things broadly rather than a technical regurgitation of the Laws. 

 I think we should add brief info on fouls and misconduct. Tehre is already an article on offside that we can easily link to. 

 This will all add to the article length so we may have to spin off some of the more detailed info to other articles, eg the nitty-gritty of the FOP could go to a devoted article. 

 A section on general gameplay would probably be beneficial too.

33949d37608e723c,"== Driver nationalities == 

 Hi there. An issue has again risen over Max Verstappen's racing nationality. An IP kept changing it to Belgian and an editor subsequently removed the field entirely. There is a [Verstappen#Nationality 2|discussion] over the matter and the editor does not seem to believe that the F1 Driver Infobox nationality field only lists racing nationality. They have asked me for a link to the discussion that achieved that consensus. This practice has been in use for a very long time, in any case much longer than I have been around. I therefore don't know where to search for it. I have found a few discussion over driver nationality in the WikiProject's archives but nothing satisfying. Since you have been around here much longer than me and seem to have participated in most of the discussion I've come across on my search, I was wondering I you might be able to help to point the editor to what they want. 1"

 == The redirect templates in the article - is racism only about prejudice against Black people? == 

 Greetings.  - I'm referring to your contribution here: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Racism&diff;=606205379&oldid;=606204626 

 Now, yes indeed, I did remove the templates. Ok, I will explain why I did it - because in my opinion they suggest that racism can be only and exclusively anti-Black, which is a lie and is unjust to other racial/ethnic groups. With all due respect and love for Black people - there are also such ethnic groups like Hispanics, Jews, Poles, Gypsies, Armenians, Asians, the Irish, Native Americans etc, who also suffered ethnicity-based prejudice back in history, and many of them still do. What is more, I don't understand why """"Racism in Russia"""" against Black Africans is so """"important"""" that it's highlighted right at the begining of the main article about racism. Racism is everywhere across the world, so please explain why specifically anti-African sentiment in Russia is so important that it needs to be stressed out in such a way. If so, then let's also highlight racism in Spain and Portugal, racism in France, in Britain and in the Netherlands - the countries that took active part in the Atlantic Slave Trade.   """
