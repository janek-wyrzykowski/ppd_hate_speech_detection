Please correct this error otherwise this injustice and blocking comments are going to harm both innocent editors ( User: 32.177.111.155 and User: 209.183.55.115  ) and their zeal to work on wikipedia and their future contributions/history as well.

Why User Talk: 32.177.111.155's Block was unjustified

User Talk: 32.177.111.155’s edits do not constitute vandalism

He simply restored duly referenced text. 
 Proof 1
 Proof 2
 Proof 3

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 did not violate WP:3rr 

He did not violate WP:3RR and he simply quit editing.

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 can not be a called a sockpuppet

 It was mentioned that User: 209.183.55.115 is licensed to Concord, CA and User: 32.177.111.155 is licensed to Los Angeles. Both of these cities are 6-7 hours of drive from each other? And it usually takes 1.5 hours of flight time if you want to fly from one city to another. 
  against violation of Wikipedia policies. Is simple warning constitute sockpuppetry?
If  had owned 2nd IP 209.183.55.115 as well, then he could have participated in the edit war through 2nd IP while staying within WP:3RR. It means he was not related to the 2nd IP at all.

Why ’s edits constitute violation of Wikipedia policies

Edit 1 
edit 2 
Edit 3 

Editor  repeatedly lied

 lied/mislead Wikipedia community through his edit summaries and statements.
Edit 1 – edit summary “Google Books isn't a very reliable source. Find a better source than that..”
edit 2 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
Edit 3 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
again lied that city of Concord and city of Los Angeles are next to each other to get the opposing editors blocked under sock category.

Editor  repeatedly violated WP:POV 

User:Neutralhomer ruthlessly suppressed others voice and kept on removing the referenced text by blatantly refusing to accept the wp:rs reliability of various internationally known newspapers and a very notable google book which is already part of wikipedia, i.e. Reduced to Ashes (book).

Advertise it as purely to get inexperienced editors reviewing. Make it clear that there will be help right the way through the process and they can't really make too much of a mess.
See if you can get some regulars who are willing to have their articles reviewed by these new reviewers. That should help alleviate any biting issues. The bonus for the regulars is that they will get there articles reviewed faster.
I would not treat this as a way to clear the backlog, but to get those reviewers who have considered reviewing, but were a little unsure whether they could. This has the added bonus of increaing reviewer numbers (and so reducing the backlog) and making sure the new reviewers devlelop good habits from the start.

Eleland

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a """"kangaroo court"""" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

Yep. LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) 
By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hank Zipzer is a fifth grader who consistently gets in trouble and has learning difficulties. In this book, Hank’s dad, Stanley Zipzer, raced into the room where the Zipzer family was sitting. Excited he exclaimed, “Road trip!” He was so happy that he knocked over the Raisin Bran Hank was eating. Fortunately, Cheerio, their dog, consumed the spilled cereal; the Zipzer family never needed to clean up anything since they got Cheerio. Hank asked if they had to come as well with Stan and Randi Zipzer, Hank’s parents. Emily, who always liked to answer people’s questions explained that they would never let them stay home with the TV remote and microwave dinners. The only reason dad wanted to go on a road trip was because there was a crossword puzzle tournament; Hank’s dad loved crossword puzzles and when he saw one, he never took his eyes of it. The only things Hank could say were wow, oh wow and wowee wow wow wow. Mum promises that they would go to a theme park, called Colossus Coaster Kingdom. They were also allowed to bring one special guest of their choice along with them. Emily chooses Katherine, her iguana, and Hank chooses Frankie Townsend. 
Ms Adolf gives Hank a homework packet which has nine-hundred pages and Hank cannot go on any of the rides until he finishes all of his homework. They are all allowed to choose a place to stop at. Dad picked a library. Emily and Katherine choose the science museum. Frankie Townsend picks a basketball court. Mum chooses a honey farm and Hank chooses the theme park. Dad looked at the library, Emily studied the museum, mum looked the farm and they went to a hotel where Hank loses his homework; Frankie had to give up twenty pounds and his trip to the court just to save Hank. Hank doesn’t finish his homework on time and cannot go on any of the rides; he had to watch his dad complete all his crossword puzzles. Mr Zipzer becomes one of the top five people who participated. Everyone didn’t complete the puzzle in the time that was given. First place was Martina Stone from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Second place was HANK’S DAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Merge of Emerald Ash borer """"Infestation"""" with Emerald Ash borer
Kingofaces43, the formation of a separate page was necessary at this time because many of the subject facts covered in second page regarding Human actions induced by EAB does not fit the first. Eventually both might be merged into a streamlined example such as one completed about Dutch Elm disease. I think you would agree one of the most prevalent items making up today event is the unbelievable amount of misinformation continually supplied to the public Consciousness about this subject, including unproven theory from the best of tree Experts. So my goal is to utilize scientific peer review and field studies, along with other proven facts to correctly educate. Including successes and failures along with details about control through treatment also. Or are we supposed to produce a unique wiki page covering facts of how scientists properly apply insecticides. Yes even some facts seperatly belong within their specific wiki pages, like possible extinction of American Fraxinus placed on Fraxinus page. Or each page for 43 individual arthropods co-extinction caused by loss of ash. Separate """"Infestation"""" page would have been central location where temporally collected items regarding main subject could be kept. Lets work together, thanks.   
Hi . First off, please remember to put new sections on a talk page at the bottom (this is done automatically by using New section). That and other things are outlined at WP:TPG and help make sure things stay ordered. For content on the EAB page, there's a bit behind all those edits I made awhile back, so stick with me:

I realize a lot of stuff I condensed was your previous work, but right now everything seems to fit together well. The merging was mainly based on parsing things down, but also how we deal with scientific content at Wikipedia. It's definitely the ideal for Wikipedia articles in general that we summarize what the scientific consensus is on topics such as this. If you haven't already, I highly suggest reading WP:SCIRS, which gives a good outline on what we should be trying to do with scientific content. Essentially, we're striving to summarize what other reliable sources say for an encyclopedia. That means pulling from review articles since they do that for us. However, part of that is because we don't generally regard primary sources (i.e. research articles) as reliable because those are communications within the scientific community. That's because those articles are intended for other researchers to evaluate, and the general public (e.g. Wikipedia editors) are not qualified to assess whether the study was valid. For us as Wikipedia editors, we cannot assign what we call due WP:WEIGHT to an idea or specific study until it's put in context through other researchers commenting on it or giving it validity (e.g. review articles). Now an introduction section can count as a mini-review article, but we generally don't need that in this topic since we have a few review articles to pull from. 

With all that said, it is not our goal to describe what the primary research is. That's why I cut down a lot of the content as it was reading more like a journal than an encyclopedia (see WP:NOTJOURNAL). It's very different writing content for say an academic paper than it is for a Wikipedia article. From what I've gathered about your edits, you're very interested in generating very detailed information, which is perfectly normal for someone just getting their feet wet on scientific content here. However, the general goal of an encyclopedia is to have summarized information with references that lead to the more detailed information. A lot of the edits you're probably interested in including still largely fall under that question of due weight such as whether we even include the content or how much detail does it get. It's a learned skill, so I'm happy to explain things further at the EAB page is it's directly related or here if it's more general (i.e. Wikipedia's policies and guidelines) if you have questions or something isn't clear.

Lansing in """"Southern Michigan""""?
I think not. What is the source or justification for this apparently arbitrary decision? I say """"apparently arbitrary"""" because I can find no evidence that the regions of Michigan are official governmental designations.

 The media (Lansing State Journal, and TV Stations WLNS, WILX, WSYM)
all refer to Lansing as being in Mid-Michigan.

 A Google search for the terms Lansing and """"Mid Michigan"""" turns up many hits that would lead one to believe that Lansing is a part of """"Mid-Michigan.

 Conversely, a Google search for Lansing and """"Southern Michigan"""" turns up mostly references where Lansing happens to be mentioned in the same work as a reference to something outside of the Lansing area (in Southern Michigan).

 There are a number of businesses and organizations based in Lansing with """"Mid-Michigan"""" in their title. In the Lansing phone book, I find at least 50 businesses listed whose name begins with """"Mid-Michigan"""" (or """"Mid Michigan""""). I find one whose name begins with """"Southern Michigan"""".

I would argue that the boundary between """"Mid"""" (or Central) and """"Southern"""" Michigan lies somewhere south of Lansing and somewhere just north of Jackson. Perhaps [Leslie, Michigan|Leslie]] is nearer the border. I believe that once could safely draw the border to include all of Ingham County.

On these grounds, I suggest that in the name of factual accuracy, Lansing be moved (at least in Wikipedia) from """"Southern Michigan"""" to """"Central Michigan"""" (for which """"Mid-Michigan"""" is said to be a synonym).   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Strong Oppose - While Autism and Asperger's are known to be related spectrum disorders, there are very distinct symptoms involved.  If DSM V does change it's perspective on this in three years time, then we can revisit this - but it's certainly not the job of Wikipedia to pre-judge that. Quite the opposite, in fact.  The current DSM IV is the authoritative document - an unfinished draft of a possible future edition is most certainly not.  There is no urgency here - we don't have to jump at the smallest news item - we're here to take the longer, more considered route - and that means revisiting this when DSM V is actually published, and not a day earlier.

I know many Pashtuns did great damages on non-Pashtuns and devided them by their varieties but in return many non-Pashtuns dominate them with their cultural- lingusitical superiority . Today, those who are responsible for killings and lootings are sitting on the streets or get killed. Many Pashtuns have lost everything and live under the right of existence. The Mohammadzai were known to be wealthy and very rich and giving Afghanistan it´s ruling class with it´s royals, but today they do not differ from Kuchis and the drug-infected people of Kabul or Hazaras of Behsud or Tajiks of Kandahar. The same things I am writing here I always tell to my own friends and relatives. Let´s stop these idiocy and work together.

 SEAL demographic issues 

The SEALs have a longstanding demographic issue, as indicated here  from TIME magazine. An editor is expressing claims that notation of this in the Wiki article """"does not represent"""" the article from TIME, but this is dishonest. From the article:
Gaps exist in minority representation in both officer and enlisted ranks for Special Warfare operators. Diverse officers represent only ten percent of the officer pool (for example, African Americans represent less than 2% of SEAL officers). Diverse enlisted SEALs account for less than twenty percent of the total SEAL enlisted population. Naval Special Warfare is committed to fielding a force that represents the demographics of the nation it serves. This contract initiative seeks effective strategies to introduce high potential candidates from diverse backgrounds to the opportunities available in Naval Special Warfare.

In other words, the SEALs admit: they have a demographic problem stemming from being an almost entirely whites-only group that has come from issues in their recruiting chain and the Navy is trying to remedy this problem.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Military history WikiProject Newsletter, Issue I 

 The Military history WikiProject Newsletter Issue I - March 2006  Project news
 An independent military history peer review has been created for the benefit of the project.  A number of articles have already been reviewed, receiving significantly more feedback within the project than they did on the generic peer review page.
 The project's Collaboration of the Fortnight got off to a great start with Ferdinand Foch and is now focusing on the military history of Spain.
 Two new task forces—dealing with warfare during classical antiquity and the Middle Ages—have been created.
 An effort to build a catalogue of high-quality maps for use in military history articles is now underway.
 The newly-formed translation department is looking for volunteers to help with translating featured articles from other-language Wikipedias. From the Coordinators
Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Military history WikiProject's newsletter!  We hope that this new format will help members—especially those who may be unable to keep up with some of the rapid developments that tend to occur—find new groups and programs within the project that they may wish to participate in.  

Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.

, Lead Coordinator Current proposals
 Proposed guidelines for categories of military people are currently being discussed.  A number of issues have already been resolved, but the proposed scheme is still in draft form and further input would be very welcome.

OIT does not say that """"PIE=Vedic"""", this is what the bulk of naive Hindu patriots (and I do not include Nobleeagle in their number) do not get. Elst's """"semi-reasonable"""" OIT """"emerging model"""" (""""emerging"""" being a way of saying that nobody believes in it """"yet"""") would mean that the Mature IVC was the home of Proto-Indo-Iranian, which isn't """"Vedic"""". The Vedic period begins with the RV, which would date to later than 1900 BC in both OIT and AIM models. 
Nobleeagle: yes, I said I would be willing to present OIT as a reasonable alternative on similar footing as the Anatolian hypothesis, which is itself  rather fringy and mainly advocated by a single scholar. The solid mainstream consensus is that PIE has """"Kurgan"""" origins in the widest sense (which themselves may be open to a lot of varying interpretations).

Again, I began by saying that I don't think the word is perfect and that it needed to be worked out here rather than simply excised with an NPOV comment on the edit. And, actually, I do have a similar remark from Raul Hilberg's mouth later in the article, but I don't believe that this entirely addresses POV/NPOV. My point is not to say that the Anschluss cannot be viewed as the military annexation of Austria but that to view it as """"simply"""" that would be to """"misunderstand"""" its essence, which would not in any case provide anything like absolution but does have the effect of changing the subject (hence my wording """"tends to conceal""""). In any case, to make such a claim without remarking on its limited analytic value and obvious propaganda value would be to set aside a number of basic facts presented elsewhere in the article, and to simply reiterate an argument without quotation or attribution and in any case without pointing out what immediately contradicts it is POV of a subtle sort. Certainly you can always resort to attributing remarks to """"some"""" and """"others,"""" but this is below the Gallup level of presenting opinions and does little to inform the reader or grasp essential truths.

But the sentence that was in the article doesn't.

 You are correct that there was a citation, one reason I did not mention it is I had no access to what was cited so there was no reason to mention it, as what was said was illogical, cite or no cite.  With regards to what is being discussed - we can discuss what is POV and not POV, what belongs where and so forth, and compromise and whatnot, but this sentence was so illogical and so out of wack it seems to demand change.  I looked up the cite and now understand the problem.  Let us compare what was said in the old opening to the opening of what J.E. Roemer said in the cite.

 Old opening - Thus, in Marx’s labour theory of value, value is considered as a measure of labor exploitation,[1] rather than of price.

 The first sentence of the work cited - For Marx, the labour theory of value was not a theory of price, but a method for measuring the exploitation of labour.

 Roemer says that for Marx the labor theory of value is a method for measuring the exploitation of labour, and is not a theory of price.  Which may be correct or incorrect, which may be phrased well or phrased confusingly, but at least it makes sense as an argument.  Roemer does not say value is considered a measure of labor exploitation.  There is a big difference between """"labor theory of value...method"""" and value itself.  Whether or not one agrees with Roemer, or thinks his sentence is well-written or not, he is not saying what he is cited in the article as saying.

Okay with regards to that last little comment: How about you try choking on my balls you over 
excitable ancient. Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive, and I have most 
certainly received a substantial quantity from you. You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in """"chat-rooms"""" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical """"angry"""" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22.

043ae7fd267f1c40,"deleted response to comments on wikipedia talk:Wikiproject Ships 

Please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia. 

In this particular case, the discussion was started by user Brad, who made a personal comment about me. Now, I dont mind this, I was more curious than offended, but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which I started on Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (ships)‎. You claimed that my post which you deleted was a 'POV inserted into a neutral notice'. It may have been a POV, about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later, but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work, and thus the implicit POV that it was undesireable. It was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting.  If you are going to start censoring postings, then I would suggest you do so impartially.  You did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice, but merely removed one comment. Rather than restoring impartiality, this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate.

Far better that you do not delete anyones comments. I would suggest reading Wikipedia:No personal attacks. I'm not sure what deleting others posts comes under, try Wikipedia:Etiquette.",0,0,0,0,0,0
18ce4727ae3e07b8,"A sound new policy?

An island cannot be a nation/culture/state in itself, nor inherently owned by anyone. I'm afraid it is simply fascistic to claim land in this way - let alone abuse powers to enforce it. When another nation covers part of the island (in this case the United Kingdom), it makes it doubly wrong. Wikipedia needs a clear policy to stop nations from claiming a land article, especially when they already have an official article. One each, you greedy scoundrels - one each. If you are really into 'history', organise it like everyone else: Historical 'era' articles simply must be subsets of the official nation article. 

I cannot stress this enough: Wikipedia should NEVER assert that any nation is a land, however long a nation has been associated with it. Read the papers - read about Europe. Read about the blood shed - read about the world. We simply cannot let this be done. But has anyone got the guts to address 'policy', I wonder?

Wikipedia uber alles? I don't think so. Wikimedia ironically owns nothing but its ventures, and this inherently right-wing 'anarchy Wikipedia' is destined to ultimately fall. If it has sense (and value), it will adapt and change instead.
 
I'd be obliged if people leave my talk page in peace now. I'm switching off my email too - it was only open for another issue.   

PS (last one). Of course the word 'country' can mean 'countryside' in an emotive sense - but that cannot be a definition regarding groups of people on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia 'top list' should be List of countries: Sovereign states/Nations/Tribes. Country should always be used as the disambiguator. No-one gets pushed out of the whole structure then (as they do now), and they are all admitted to be 'country'-connected in some way - but is doesn't include any land masses! Footnotes can be made for cases if needed - it simply won't be messier than it is now, far from it. 

People need to take up the mantle on all of this. There are many people on Wikipedia trying to engineer the 'identity mess' on Wikipedia to support their nationalistic views. At its most negative, this is often a 'comparative' matter for them - so they often go after other cases/causes more than directly push their own. The two Irelands and the very specific 'constituent countries' of the United Kingdom are always on their radar, and this crazy disruption over the Irelands now has made them stronger, without doubt.

 Lead is too narrow 
The lead states """"Adherents of the 9/11 Truth Movement deny that al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and intentionally crashed two into the World Trade Center buildings"""". I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn't preclude the use of explosives. I'm not a die hard truther, but I don't belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement). I guess these people (who seem to get all their 'facts' from Fox and CNN) explain why the US government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties (PATRIOT, NDAA, TSA, etc).

Notice to Zscout370 about SimonP's and GroundZero's Arbitary Deletion

Howdy Zscout370,

This is just to let you know that I enjoyed our conversation very much about my contribution to the Flag of Canada page.  You very very professional, easy going and nice to talk too.  However, SimonP and GroundZero have seen fit to arbitarily deem my additions as """"POV warranting Deletion"""" without any discussion.  I am not happy about such """"blatant editoral presumption"""" on their parts.  I have have no prior dealings with GroundZero, but I am """"well acquainted"""" with SimonP's style.   He loves to add material without references and that retort that they are available in comtemptary Newpaper Articles.   A claim that is quite difficult to double check, as most people are not career librarians, or such.  

At any rate for the time being, I have taken the liberity to move my Republican Tricolour contributions to a separate page, linked below,

See also French Republican Tricolour form of Canadian Maple Leaf Flag.

Just to let yaa know, any blatant deletion/editing of this new page or the link to it on the Flag of Canada page, and I shall be asking you to contact the Administrations TO LOCK BOTH PAGES for Dispute Resolution.

Take care, and best wishes eh,

 Requested move 15 September 2015

According to The European Vitis Database Tinta Caiada is a cultivar name and Parraleta is used as a prime name.

""""The Spanish name Parraleta has been chosen here as the prime name because it’s the name used in its likely place of origin, the Somontano region in the province of Huesca, north-east Spain (Casanova Gascón 2008), as suggested by Vacarel’s 1765 reference to it under the old synonym Parrel (Montaner et al. 2004). <...> Comparison of the DNA profiles of Tinta Caiada (Almadanim et al. 2004), cultivated in the Alentejo in Portugal, and Carenisca (Zecca et al. 2010), grown on the Italian island of Sardegna, and Salceño Negro (Ibañez et al. 2003) from Somontano with that of Parraleta (Martín et al. 2003) suggests that they are one and the same.""""

JayW - Predators do not scrutinize the internet in the hopes of tracking some kid who foolishly posted their name to Wikipedia. It simply doesn't happen. It doesn't happy here, nor does it happen anywhere else; and I would be happy to concede to anyone who proves otherwise, though I very much doubt that will happen. I whole-heartedly believe the situation this policy is designed to protect against is a terrible myth which, by distracting money, time and effort from actual issues, facilitates the sexual abuse of children.

On the other hand, some predators do use the chat services to anonymously groom children. This situation, while I doubt it would happen in such an incovenient environment, might deserve a policy.

..so, does this policy solve anything, as it stands? No - it doesn't prevent children from stating their age. Instead, it focuses on irrelevant information, like their street address and real name, which the predator can acquire privately once he has located the child's online contact information. Since many people use the same username across all the interwebs, this probably wouldn't be difficult.

The only solution, so far as I can see, is to police kids who mention their age. Any other policy is, to say the least, completely useless. Out,

Wow that's nice. Go ahead and add it to the gallery, if that's where you'd like it. Bold text

 Unneccessary reference 
Is Samurai Champloo important enough to be included in this article? It doesn't seem to add much to the article. Why's every article I look at have some reference to anime?

Why does every other article I read have reference to some American Sitcom or other live-action medium? It's a part of popular culture, that's why. The Sunflower Samurai as well as Sunflowers themselves are a HUGE central plot point that dominates almost every single episode.

So post it in the Samurai Champloo article. Anime is not central nor even moderately relevant to actual sunflowers.

If it is at the end, labeled, and sufficiently known information, why not have it?  

 why do sunflowers """"want"""" to follow the sun? 

what do they get out of it? is this known? guessed by relevant public work? I myself would even take a clue, here. (thats I really wanna get info on this) Bye and thanks.  

Heliotropic flowers are more prevalent among plants in alpine areas. The absorbed light makes the flowers warmer, which attracts more pollinating insects. http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1998.00336.x?cookieSet=1   May be the sunflower's heliotropism is a rudimentary feature from an alpine past?  

 Pizarro? 

It says that he cultivated them around 1000 B.C.... but this is impossible because Pizarro didn't even go to the Americas until the 16th century A.D.

256199a98ac60f93,"English English vs American English vs ...

In an earlier edit changing petrol to gas, I wrote in the edit comment that I was changing the wording to American English (gas) because that's the standard for this Wikipedia. Another user pointed out that my assertion of an American English standard for this Wikipedia was incorrect according to the Wikipedia Manual of Style. That user is correct. I was unaware of the Manual of Style's position on this, so I read into it. According to the MoS, there is no standard form of English for the English language Wikipedia. Instead, the language that one uses in a given article depends on: 1) the form of English most closely associated with the topic, and 2) the form of English used by the first major contributor to the article. The article should, in any case, adhere to one standard form of English (for example, American English, British English, Canadian English, Indian English, or Australian English)

I'd like to talk about this for a bit, because I think we may have an interesting boundary case in this article that helps further define the MoS policy on how to select the correct English variant for an article.

English language variants and Unimogs
Item 1 above says that the version of English used in an article should be the one most closely aligned with the subject. The Unimog is a German truck, and so one would have a hard time saying that there is a particular form of English closely aligned with the topic, at least when it's spoken of in Germany. The Unimog has an especially weak association with England, as the British military and farm trades did not (as far as I know) make much use of the Unimog, instead heavily prefering the British designed and built Land Rovers. The Unimog was used in many other nations, however, including Switzerland (by the Swiss military) and some nations in Africa and Asia. I am not aware of the modern history of the Unimog outside of Europe, but I know that in the 60s and 70s, when it was at its peak in terms of exposts, it was purchased in these regions for military applications. In Asia and Africa, I am unaware of any particularly strong association between the Unimog and a given variant of English.

There was one market the Unimog was sold in where there was a strong association with a particular variant of English, and that was the United States. Daimler-Benz, through its dealers and representatives, has sold and services Unimogs in the United States for I believe over twenty years. 

To add to American English argument, in recent years, Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler. Chrysler is a US company.

Further, the US company Applied Minds as widely publicized a variant of the Unimog called the Maximog. This Unimog has received press coverage (a Google search turns up articles on this project in the US newsmedia).

I believe that the Unimog sold more units and has a higher profile in the United States than in any other nation where English is the official language, though perhaps Canada could make a claim. I would like to hear whether others feel that the Unimog has a particularly strong association with Britain, Canada, India, Australia, or another country whose version of English is widely recognized?

English language provenance of the article
Item 2 above refers to the version of English used by the first major contribution to the article (excluding stubs).

I wrote the first version of this article in Sept 2002, and I think I could argue that this was a non-stub creation in American English. The article remained unexpanded until 2004, when other editors added content to it. These edits largely retained the American spelling, but (wisely) introduced metric measurements, which I believe are most strongly associated with Unimogs  I would be surprised if a German-engineered vehicle was built in terms of feet and pounds!

During The Dangerous Tour in 1993 Michael Jackson had planned to visit Mexico. The initial dates for the concerts in Mexico City were planned to be as following: 29/10/1993, 31/10/1993, 2/11/1993, 4/11/1993 and 6/11/1993. The first 2 concerts were done as planned.

Now, Jackson had problems with his health and the last 3 concerts were postponed. The dates for the last three concerts were then set as following: 7/11/1993, 9/11/1993 and 11/11/1993.

There were also some minor plans to take Jackson also to Monterrey after Mexico City dates, but these plans were then cancelled, because Jackson cancelled the whole tour on November 12 because of ill health.

Now, please do not any more change the fourth Mexico City concert date! It was planned to take place on November 4, not November 3!! Please also read Lisa D. Campbell book, which has been mentioned in the article.

Hi, for military-theme articles like US 2nd Armored Division I generally use the dd-mm-yyyy style for dates because that is the US military standard, and that's what readers (US or otherwise) will expect to see.

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

I'd hardly say this is blind.... after all the article has suffered extensively since June 5th. Going through the phrasing of everything now could take a good editor of an encyclopedia days, and we'll be fighting against other edits. Look at the following:
""""Everything Revere told his British captors had a single goal, to move the soldiers away from Lexington, where he had left Hancock and Adams. Revere had reason to believe the patrol's mission was to arrest the two Patriot leaders. He and other captives taken by the patrol were still escorted east toward Lexington, until about a half mile from Lexington they heard a gunshot. The British major demanded Revere explain the gunfire, and Revere replied it was a signal to """"alarm the country"""". A few minutes later, came a flurry of gunfire that seemed to alarm the British captors even beyond the panic they were already in.""""

All of that is based on a single book, takes up a significant portion of the article, and itself the source hasn't been verified to be objective. The style its written in suggests to me it may also be lifted word for word from the book, and to me at least seems to break NPOV. And that last line, """"alarm the British captors even beyond the panic they were already in"""" takes a whole lot of liberties, nevermind certainly not being encyclopedic.
@ JeffJonez: I'm proposing a revision from 4 days ago, not a week. And much of what remains in the article from since the June 5th edits began is hardly verifiable or objective, and certainly doesn't maintain a neutral tone to the article. Determining where and when this all began is proving troubling as so much was added and removed, then added again. This is hardly just a few malcontents.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

A government making unsubstantiated accusations at a country they're at war with may be """"official"""", but it's unimportant for an article about a weapon. The type of missile used in this alleged attack is of no importance, and the fact that they even mentioned the Iskander specifically points to obvious political motivations in the accusations (ie. your're using your shiny new hi-tech weapon to destroy civilian infrastructure, shame on you!) This sort of political bickering has no place in the article in my opinion. There are specific articles and sections to put government propaganda.

Wikipedia is supposed to work because although people have differing opinions, there is supposed to be some consensus other wise it’s just endless revert war.

Again, if they want to look at pretty pictures, there are plenty of other places online where they can view them. San Francisco's skyline has undergone many changes in the last 5 years and its dishonest, changes that have been mentioned in other wikipedia article, and not to show that to people looking up information on the city and show them a instead 8 year old photo just because it """"looks prettier"""".
As i'm mentioning yet again, I don't see why we can just settle for now until someone goes and takes a different picture.

59f44dcc5ecd4051,"""As the Chinese Civil War ended, the communist party took control of Mainland China and founded the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. The Kuomintang (and the Republic of China) retreated to Taiwan. 
Though fighting, including the invasion of several coastal islands by the Communists (with both successes and failures), the bombing of Shanghai and other coastal cities by the Republic of China Air Force, as well as a guerilla campaign waged by remaining Kuomintang forces in southwest China, would continue for the next several years, by the time of the Korean War the lines of control were sharply drawn: the Communist-led People's Republic of China government in Beijing controlled most of mainland China, while the Kuomintang-led Republic of China government, now in Taipei, controlled the island of Taiwan, some surrounding islands, and a number of islands off the coast of Fujian. This stale-mate was enforced with the assistance of the United States government, which, after the start of the Korean War, changed from a policy of abandoning Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang regime to the Communists, to protecting Taiwan against an invasion from the mainland, in the First Taiwan Strait Crisis.
Until the 1990s, both governments contended to be the sole legitimate government of China. With the fighting largely over, the major battleground became the diplomatic. Before the 1970s, few foreign governments recognised the People's Republic of China. The first governments to recognise it as the government of China were Soviet bloc countries, members of the non-aligned movement, and the United Kingdom (1950). The catalyst to change came in 1971, when the United Nations General Assembly expelled representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek by refusing to recognise their accreditations as representatives of China. Recognition for the People's Republic of China soon followed from most other governments, including the United States. The Republic of China continued to complete with the People's Republic of China to be recognised as the legitimate government of China.
Since the 1990s, however, a rising movement of for formal recognition of Taiwanese independence has made the political status of Taiwan the dominant issue, replacing the debate about the legitimate government of China. One significant opinion in Taiwan is that the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are both sovereign, thus forming """"two Chinas"""", or """"one China, one Taiwan"""". The current administration of Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian subscribes to this theory, and accordingly has largely abandoned the campaign for the Republic of China to be recognised as the sole legitimate government of China. Instead, it is campaigning for the Republic of China to join the United Nations as representative of its effective territory - Taiwan and nearby islands - only.

Hello

I noticed that you have wrote on my talk page. I do know the user McFly85 personally. We both were in a computer lab checking out wikipedia one time and we talked about how the quality of certain areas of articles were a little lacking. He also told me about his tattered history on wikipedia, where he had his user page edited, without consent, by SWD316/Moe Epsilon. Then, someone else vandalized SWD316's user page, and put the blame on mcfly, which I'm fairly sure he would not do. Mcfly did make a few other accounts during a RFA as he was worried that if SWD316 would be given moderator powers, that he would be unfairly banned. And if you look at Mcfly85's edit history, he has made a wealth of good edits, mainly proofreading issues, but also a lot with NPOV, stub sorting, and even creating an article every once in awhile. In my opinion, even with all the alleged sockpuppet abuse, mcfly85 has been a strong asset to wikipedia. If it wasn't for this user, as lot of previous errors and formatting mistakes would have gone unnoticed, and would harm the quality of this site. He had no intention of becoming a moderator, but always intended to improve, even if only slightly, any article that was lacking quality. I feel bad that the actions of Moe Elipson have pretty much caused mcfly, my friend, to lose trust in this site and he has since retired his name. He did come back under another name, and made some great edits, but then, was unfairly (IMO) banned for being a 'sockpuppet used abusively"""". There is a difference between being a sockpuppet and trying to use a new name to get a fresh start.

But I am not mcfly85. I am fairly new to being a serious editor on wikipedia, and I was just checking some various parts of the site. I then noticed on the RFAs section that this familiar name came up, and I saw mcfly's screenname in the questions answered by Moe Elpison. I really didn't want other users have what happened to mcfly happen to them, so I voted opposed, which I am allowed to do as a user. I do not feel that I """"unfairly influenced"""" the voters, I think the voting results would have been the same weather I had voted or not. And I have never heard of Araxen, and I did not create or am involved with that user. That vote should not have counted. 

I just wanted to explain my case to you. I also question that Moe Elipson's user page may be in violation of the no personal attacks policy. He calls McFly85 some very harsh names, such as a stalker. I think that content that bashes other users should be removed, there is no place for that anywhere. But thanks for asking, I hope to keep making solid contibutions to the encyclopedia, it's a fun hobby.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Project News
Wikinews has started a series of interviews with noteworthy past Eurovision contestants, which will be published through May. So far  of our project has interviewed 1982 winner Nicole, 1973 winner Anne Marie David, two-time entrant Edsilia Rombley, and soon to be three-time entrant Chiara Siracusa.
 The backlog of assessments in the project is still ongoing, with a large number of articles not being rated. If you see articles without the  template on the article's talk page, please add it, or read Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment if you would like to help assess the articles as well. With the help of , , and  in the past month, the assessment level has passed 50%!
 Remember to source all information you add to pages properly or else it may be removed, and always use an edit summary so other users know why you are adding or removing information.
 If you are going to make a page for a song in the contest, please make it more than a stub so it does not get deleted.

 From the Members
Welcome to the seventh edition of the WikiProject Eurovision newsletter! It has been a busy month full of national finals and homework for school, so I apologize for publishing the newsletter so late. 

The deadline for choosing the entries is right around the corner and following its passing, we will have a great opportunity to improve the quality of the articles in our project. There are many song stubs that have been created for the entries this year and I would like to see them expanded into coherent articles. Also, I think we need to take a look back at the """"Country in ESC 2009"""" articles because I have noticed that most of them are out of date and need to be updated. 

We need to focus more on quality these days instead of just adding new info wherever it fits. Our goals is not to jam as much info o",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Wikipedia and copyright 
 Hello Perrytrev, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to Framlingham College has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied or translated without attribution. If you want to copy or translate from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

The words you said it stands for, """"Dismantling our Governments Selling our Cities"""", a Google search comes up with again, nothing:  None of this has anything to do with POV, it has to do with, again, verifiability and reliable, third-party sources that establish the notability. Yes, USA, UN, and many, many other acronyms have pages here, but they are notable, mentioned in the news, media, and other reliable sources. This acronym is not. Further, you may wish to review the single purpose account guide as well. Thanks, Ariel♥Gold 
Docsoc, as Ariel said above, there are no google results, I always do a search prior to deleting articles, Wikipedia articles are not deleted without investigation. Provide three, verifiable third-party reliable sources, and I'll look into restoring the article.   † """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Dc76! About Anittas, I regret very much what happened to him, and I maintain that he was dealt with too harshly, and I intended to protest his indefinite block. However, he informed me that he has decided to leave Wikipedia, and that even if the block can be shortened that he is not interested in returning. I find his decision unfortunate, but that is his own choice. 

As for Moldova, thanks for your offer of help. The article is in a rather sorry state, and I always had it at the top of my list but never quite got around to it. Indeed, there is much work to be done. I am trying to make the article follow the guidelines listed on Wikipedia:WikiProject Countries. As my model, I have other featured articles on countries, such as Belgium, Turkey, and Germany. The problem is that now there is little structure to the Moldova article and much random (and some inaccurate) information. Of course, if there is relevant data, I don't want it lost, so if it's just too detailed for the main article, it should be moved to the sub-articles. My idea for a schedule was to first create the skeleton of the article, meaning that only the sections from the Countries projects should be kept and rest integrated or moved. Then, all the sections need to be reworked, some to be expanded, others made more compact, others need sources (and most existing sources need to be changed to standard formats). Then, various issues of style need to be changed (i.e. to make the article pretty), which means finding some nice images, making the tables look nicer, etc. And finally, the article will need to be copy-edited and checked for errors. So if you want to help, it would be great if you could work on any of those aspects, or any other. See you around!",0,0,0,0,0,0

ae7e01fa4c952931,""":::: sprot only blocks IP (and brand new) addresses from editing - it does not stop anyone from reading, nor does it stop anyone who wants to contribute to create an account with an unidentifiable and untraceable name (i.e., don't give your email address) and contribute.  The edits made by multiple IP addresses on this page, as you know,  have been (not always but  by and large) at best unhelpful but much more often downright offensive and I see absolutely no reason why that should be allowed to continue.  Again, you know I am not talking about the juvenile HI MOMs - they are also annoying, but that is not what plagues this page.  We are plagued by targeted vandalism - changing """"Obama"""" to """"Osama"""", for example, and the regular changing of text that has hidden text clearly requesting that it not be changed right there, plus blatant POV pushing, trolling, etc.  Classic case for permanent sprot. The result, when sprot is in place, is the ability to conscientiously edit and improve the article (which has a changing base of facts so needs constant attention).  But rather than being able to easily evaluate substantive changes that responsible editors make, we are bogged down in having to go through screen after screen of pure and often vicious vandalism. For what positive reason, may I ask?

IP edits also can be used, I suppose, by regular editors who don't want to reveal that they are making sub rosa changes, but I would hope that is not going on here.  

And IP addresses have quite rarely reverted vandalism here - in fact I just looked at the last 500 edits and didn't see a single case of an IP address reverting vandalism. Maybe I missed one, but that claim was not really reflective of what goes on on this page - it is a very small group of actual editors who do the vast majority of the reverting.  

Your comment above about there being only one vandalism on Dec 21 was just one day after sprot was lifted the last time. I said then that I hoped to be wrong, but predicted that vandalism would be back up and it is.  That's why I requested extended protection.

If what  you were unhappy about is the tag itself, I also thought all along that we should have {{sprotect2}} and had thought to change it last time but the block was lifted before I had a chance to.   I have changed it to that less obtrusive tag.  The question of the duration  of the lock is what I am interested in. Two-three weeks is much better than what we had a few weeks ago, and may coincide with any announcement that Senator Obama makes which is also good timing for sprot, but  I'd like to understand why you would want it not to be an extended one, because I can't make any sense out of your position on this, as a person (you, I mean) who clearly is interested in having this remain a high quality page, as evidenced by the excellent work you do here, and the fact that this page has been by far your main area of Wikipedia editing.    | talk

It would be good to add Japanese sources to the gaming articles to expand their reception sections because the inclusion of sources from different nationalities helps to reduce systemic bias and POV. Naturally English Wikipedia will use mostly English-language sources, and naturally there are a lot of high-quality English-language RSes, and these are sufficient to demonstrate a game's notability, etc., but high-quality or major non-English and multinational sources would address Wikipedia's second pillar by reducing or eliminating cultural biases in the reporting. It sounds to me like reviews from GAMEST would be a great addition to Wikipedia for this reason.
For articles on games created in non-English-language countries, I think it's also very helpful for a full grasp of the topic to include reception from the originating culture. So in my view, reviews from Japanese sources like Famitsu or GAMEST should be used to expand the articles on Japanese games whenever possible. (And similarly, reviews from French magazines would be helpful for French games, and Russian magazines for Russian games, etc.). I have heard that Famitsu is considered Japan's premier video game magazine so I think that its reviews for Japanese games are particularly helpful, and I have been adding them to gaming articles recently, but thanks for bringing my attention to GAMEST too. If I happen to pick up any copies of it I'll try to add reviews from there as well. Cheers, -",0,0,0,0,0,0

I wasn't questioning the """"literary forgery"""" issue i.e. """"hoax"""" but the claim that """"plagiarism"""" isn't used here in the lead except as a partisan view when looking at the sources of the document. Given that the document was published well after the death of the source author (whom it is alleged borrowed from an earlier source anyway) your example isn't remotely relevant. The chain of authorship isn't as simplistic as your example. An alternative presentation of plagiarism is the Origin_of_the_Book_of_Mormon#Purported_plagiarism because of the intent of the author but oddly enough the Book_of_Mormon article doesn't mention """"plagiarism"""" at all. Here it is the reverse with numerous use of wording for """"plagiarism"""" and in the lead paragraphs but yet with no clear idea how the (mostly) anonymous authors would gain from the plagiarism i.e. gain from the reputation of Maurice Joly. The claim of """"plagiarism"""" only works if there is an unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Now the problem for you is that Serge Nilus did plagiarise the protocols but the protocols themselves are not plagiarised but derivative. If no one claims authorship then where does that leave the claim of plagiarism ? . That's not clearly proven here so I'm suggesting that the word """"plagiarism"""" is removed from the lead paragraph (though it can stay within the main text and elsewhere that the protocols are used in context of being derivative from the earlier work) as it unbalances the lead. """"hoax"""" and """"literary forgery"""" can obviously stay.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

CSS
Classification of the Service
CSS officer fall under two groups under Central Civil Service i.e. Group A and Group B. 

1. Selection Grade (Deputy Secretary or equivalent) -Belongs to Central Civil Service Group ‘A’
2. Grade-I (Under Secretary or equivalent) -Belongs to Central Civil Service Group ‘A’
3. Section Officer Grade -Belongs to Central Civil Service Group-‘B’ (Ministerial)
4. Assistant Grade -Central Civil Service Group ‘B’ (Ministerial)           

Group A officer i.e. those who belong to Grade I i.e Under Secretary and then the Selection Grade of Deputy Secretary and Directors are direct recruits from the Combined Civil Service Exam that is held all over India. Someone who belongs to Section officer and Assistant Grade are non recruits from the Civil Service Exam but are recruited through the SSC. Only a direct recruit through civil service exam can become or allotted to become an officer in the CSS cadre of posts of Under Secretary, Deputy Secretary and then Senior selection grade of Director then SAG level of Joint and Additional Secretaries.

CSS class
CSS officer total of this date to 10,000 candidates to which 2000 only belong to the Group A who are recruits through the civil service exam whereas the rest 8000 belong to the Group B and are non recruits through the non civil service exam.
See Group A Civil List (http://persmin.nic.in/CSWing/CSDivision/CSS/css_civillist/civil_list_css_2010.pdf) - See page 5 including the cover page written by the Minister.

Posts across and hold across Central Government
 See Group A Civil List (http://persmin.nic.in/CSWing/CSDivision/CSS/css_civillist/civil_list_css_2010.pdf)
If you see the civil list of CSS cadre officer of Grade A then you will see candidates are holding position all the way from Under Secretary to Deputy Secretary (both junior and senior) to Directors to Joint Secretary and even to few Additional Secretaries. 

This means that CSS group A cadre officers are holding positions from low to mid to high level executive posts in the Central Government. It is just wrong to say that they hold only lower and middle level positions in the Government. As per history, the CSS was devised primarily to manage the middle level posts in the Central Secretariat, which is the Headquarters of the Union Government but if you see the Civil list it can be clearly seen that since independence CSS has evolved and grown. Hence the Group A officer also holds posts as Joint and Additional Secretary position which is not a middle level but a SAG level position.

Group A and Group B
CSS officers belong to group A who are direct recruits and the ones who belong to Group B who are recruits through non civil service exam. You should know that both Group A and Group B officer belong to both Central Civil Services of the Government of India.

The golden ratio naturally appears in the 5th roots of unity; if you plot the roots in the complex plane, they form the vertices of a pentagon. This then explains why you can express a lot of trigonometric angles pi*n/5 in terms of the golden ratio. For example, cos 18 = (b/4)sqrt[2] = 5^(1/4)/2 sqrt[φ].  When you solve a quintic equation, naturally the fifth roots of unity are involved, hence why the radical solution of the quintic x^5-5x+12 = 0 can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio.

You also say that the Rin tin tin Museum was """"short lived"""" and make not reference as to where this information is substantiated and yet the Museum still exists today.

You also say that Jannettia Brodsgaaard Propps amassed a collection of memorabilia which she did not. She never collected Anything. It was Edythe Shepard of Tucson, Arizona who collected a large part of the pieces in the museum and donated them to Rin tin tin.

There are other issues with other pages such as the Lassie page - you apparently did not follow the """"conflict"""" rules with them (Carol, Joan and Chelsea - yes they are friends of ours and in fact have one of our dogs)and allowed their """"version"""" of facts that surrounded the events associated with Weatherwax. Yet you will not make corrections to things in the Rin Tin Tin article that are incorrect and that are not as self-serving as the statements in the Lassie article. Honestly it appears that you do maintain a double standard.

I now see that you have arbitrarily added that a dog name Rin Tin Tin Smith attended the American Humane hero Dog Award Show in 2011 - there is no dog registered as Rin tin tin Smith and there has never been a dog called Rin Tin tin Smith. Not sure where you got your information but that too is incorrect. The call name of the dog is indeed """"Smith"""" but that is not his registered name. He is Rin Tin tin XII. We would still like to know who gave you this bogus information and it should be corrected. 

And again regarding Finding Rin Tin tin - if you have Tierney on one page should he not also be on the Finding Rin tin tin page and shouldn't you put Danny Lerner on the Rin Tin tin page.? I am sure Danny Lerner would appreciate that. If you would like a copy of the contract between First Look and Tierney we can certainly provide that to you. It specifically outlines Tierney's involvement as being only limited to a """"mention."""" He had no direct involvment in the """"making"""" of the film.

I would hope that you would research further to substantiate the 48 puppy issue. Your argument is that because someone """"mentions"""" it is a book that it is absolutely true. If that is the case then why do you discount other authors, books and writings?  You defend Orlean's writings as though they were your own and discount anyone else's, including English. That is surely a double standard and certainly NOT professional in any manner.

 Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mods and admins, in general, have a very biased view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles... present company excepted.
 I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... """"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons."""" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.
 Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of """"keep off MY article"""" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor.

Æµ§œš¹, I have a point of information.  Is the “In an exclusively US context” section a part of the article being discussed?   For, in this section I find the following very misleading statement: “In 1996, the term became widely known in the U.S. owing to a controversy over a decision by the Oakland School Board to denote and recognize the primary language (or sociolect or ethnolect) of African American children attending school, and thereby to facilitate the teaching of standard English.[12] Thereafter, Ebonics seems to have become little more than an alternative term for African American Vernacular English, although one emphasizing its claimed African roots and independence from English, a term linked with the nationally discussed controversy over the decision by the Oakland School Board, and one avoided by most linguists.[13] “   I pose this question because I have just received a translation from the Romulus and Remus Linguistic Institute.   It appears there is an effort being made to cover–up some very, very inept and ersatz scholarship at Wikipedia encyclopedia by simply declaring my analysis of the Oakland Ebonics Controversy as something that pertains only to that article when in fact the words “For more details on this topic, see Oakland Ebonics controversy” , the words Oakland School Board (twice) and  ‘sociolect’, ‘ethnolect’ and ‘African American Vernacular English’ appear under the heading “In an exclusively US context”.    My analysis of the Oakland Ebonics controversy” was about  ‘Ebonics’ the langauage of limited English proficient (LEP) English language learners (ELL) of African ancestry in the OSUD African diaspora.   I maintain that when a counterfeiter puts the name ‘Rolex’ on a one jewel, gold plated, Hong Kong watch, this does not make a one jewel, gold plated, Hong Kong watch a genuine Rolex.  I likewise maintain that when ignorant white trash and dumb Negro Sheepdogs that nurse at the udder of white supremacits trash use the word Ebonics as a synonynm for and African American Vernacular English this does not make Ebonics an African American Vernacular of English.

No, I see editors (those on the COI side) who appear to, or pretend to - take your pick - not understand the meanings/definitions of policies relating to BLPs, sourcing, peacocking, etc, clearly enough. As a result, the same form of inappropriate content keeps creeping back in with new excuses. I think it's more the case that some people are too keen to """"babysit"""" this article and try to make it grow, rather than let it breathe for a few weeks/months. I can understand editors being protective of articles they've just created for a while - but there comes a point when they have to stop """"updating"""" with bloat and trivial sources, for the sake of it. An author can't visit a bookshop everyday with a new edition of their book to sell, nor can authors here expect to introduce new content daily unless the article is a genuine """"current event"""".

However, I think it better that people leave the article as is for a while - better to have low notability than introduce elements that destroy it altogether and give grounds to AFD.

My apologies to those who feel that I have had a go at them in my haste to defend the LK posts. When I received the email (allegedly) from him, I genuinely thought it was him asking for support. I should have checked out the status before joining in, and it was only later that I realised that this wasn't the person that I actually know. It was clear after reading through the entire history that something was definitely not right. Geoff is quite rightly furious and is taking every step possible to find the protagonists. He has asked for his account to be suspended until further notice as he does not want this sort of thing to be repeated. I was very curious as he normally keeps his involvement in Templary quite private. There are however a few people out there who he has exposed for fraudulent activity and who will do nothing to get back at him. I am also very upset and can understand if editors do not want me to help out. Geoff's advice is to not get involved if these sort of problems can occur. But I am fairly good at reference checking, spelling and grammar if you require any help. I will also understand if you feel that my premature support without checking a real identity is disbarment to future assistance. Whichever way I wish you the best with the article on a subject that we are all like to study and promote. Geoff has emailed me to also pass on his wishes to all concerned and hopes you will understand his personal wish not to get involved.

 A Third Way 

Ok, I'm starting to see what you guys are saying. However, to be honest I don't think this article is really about the brand. The first sentence of the article is about the brand, but most of the article is about the product(s). I mean, the section on """"connectivity"""" is clearly about the connectivity of the various iPod products themselves, and not the brand. So here is what I propose: zero article in the lead (and anywhere else where we are talking about the brand), but normal usage throughout the rest of the article, where appropriate. So """"The iPod is associated with one host computer,"""" would remain the same since it's talking about the product and not the brand. This way we can maintain a grammatically euphonious format throughout, and not have to awkwardly restructure sentences to stay in line with Apple-speak. Basically my fear was that this page would end up sounding like the iPod manual, which, to anyone who has read it, is clearly super-weird.
And for the record, I am writing this on a MacBook, I have two iPods, and I love Steve Jobs. But I love the English language more.

Looking forward to your thoughts.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I support these changes. The key thing here is the placement of the counter-narrative (or call it what you will). This is a defining element of the page and of the story. Let me explain why I think it should have its own section. This page is called """"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident,"""" not ''Tiananmen Square self-immolation hoax"""", or """"Tiananmen Square staged self-immolation."""" That is correct, but at the same time it is the same name that would be used if they were confirmed Falun Gong members. Since the nature of the incident is so crucial to defining the story, and that by default the 'argument' of the piece—that is, the entire way in which the story is known to the world—is through the claim that the individuals were Falun Gong practitioners. There would be no such thing as the """"""""Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident"""" if it were not claimed that they were Falun Gong members.  In this situation, making clear that there is a well-founded counter narrative is important. It's not something to stuff away to a side-box or the corner of the article. It should not dominate the page, but it should be as prominent as the other narrative (or more so depending on the evidence and wp:due)—therefore I think placing all of that information in its own section is quite appropriate. The other speculations and disputations about the identity of the people and so forth (the parts that are not strictly evidence-based) are separate to this arc. This is my opinion, I apologise for the laborious way I communicated it. I think it is a joke to dispute Pan's investigation. That's the most solid piece of evidence available in the whole thing. Most of the rest is just image-making, speculation, video cuts, and propaganda and counter-propaganda. —Zujine|talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 I interpret it as that as we have sources that are conflicting on basic information. While each of the sources appears reliable enough none of them can be reliably, and verifiability, traced back to either reports written by the people involved with the operation or someone that interviewed them. There does seem to be wide agreement that OBL was hit twice with the first shot being somewhere in the chest/trunk (depending on the report), and the second in the head. There are conflicting reports on the number of shooters and the number of shots fired.

 We have a couple of options for the article. 1) Only report those items that seem to have wide agreement and to be silent on those details where our sources offer conflicting data. 2) Document the conflicting details along with the sources. I'd personally go with #1 as it'll be a cleaner article. We'd have a constant battle with people trying to inject a POV such as """"OBL was shot twice by one person - look at all these sources.""""

 I have a personal concern with the New Yorker version of the events in that it mentions the assault team blowing their way through doors and walls. For the first couple of days after the mission it appeared the public was allowed to wander around the compound and were only restricted from the innermost courtyard. Lots of people took photos. I never saw a photo of a hole blown into a wall nor did I see any apparent damage to the doors. Visible evidence of the assault would have been of great interest and no one took a photo? Thus, I'd say the New Yorker and other articles article is wrong on that detail. The assault team likely found the inner doors were unlocked and/or scaled the walls to get into the compound and to move between the walled off sections of the compound.

 There are other concerns about the New Yorker article in that it switches from great detail which appears to build credibility and the impression that this is an """"inside account"""" to an absence of information on basic things such as what team #1 was doing immediately after they landed. I suspect the entire thing was spun together out of speculative opinions by others. Unfortunately, many of the articles about this incident have similar issues. |talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

First of all, reverting your edit wasn't a challenge to whether or not the information was correct. It was purely based on the lack of a citation. Wikilinks are not acceptable substitutions for inline citations. Each article must be able to stand on its own set of references and not rely on a wikilink to another article's reference. Refer to WP:CITE for more information. Secondly, comparing the flags and drawing a conclusion – no matter how reasonable and obvious it might be – can be considered a form of original research which is not permitted on Wikipedia. Citing a reliable source that supports the analogy alleviates the concern. It also helps us establish the significance of the information as it relates to the topic. Without that verification, it may be a trivial observation that doesn't necessarily belong in this article (see WP:DUE). As for your """"sky is blue"""" analogy, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. Take for example the statement that """"the Eiffel Tower is in Paris"""". This is widely accepted fact that doesn't require research, and therefore doesn't require a citation. However, the statement that """"Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower"""" would need a citation, although it is easily verifiable. It may be hard to see the difference, but the rule of thumb is when you think it may be challenged, it's best to err on the side of caution and include a citation.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

But in your third guideline, theres a sentence that begins with """"Choosing: choosing"""" I think it's a great point, but I'm not quite sure that the way that it is worded fits with the rest of your guideline.

Shannon's Editing Comments:

Hello  I loved your beginning section on social support and found the definition of social support to be very helpful in my understanding. However, your second paragraph was a little too wordy for my liking and difficult to remain interested. Also, in your third paragraph """"with these types of communication.."""" you did not mention any types of communication before, and therefore you cannot use these, until after explaining each type of communication.  Finally, I would suggested maybe making your points in your verbal/non-verbal method section bulleted. Overall, you added great information to our article, take my suggestions as you wish.   

Hello  You added some great information, I am just concerned that it is all from one source, or have you not quite finished adding your additional citations? I really love your choice of bolding and italicizing your guidelines, however guideline three is not separate from guideline two, nor is it bold/italic. Finally there us a Which, in your final guildline that should not be capitalized. Great work Meagan, take my advice as you wish.   

Hello  You have made some great additions to our article, especially the use of the General Adaptive Syndrome. However, in stage three, stressor is missing a letter (small typo). You had a great point of how inadequate sleep leads to irritability, however, I suggest that you change """"less inclined to communicate"""" to less inclined to communicate effectively. Also, in your section of language barrier, you used the word intercultural, I believe interlingual is a more suitable term as culture is not only defined by language. For instance citizens of Quebec, have Canadian culture despite speaking a different language than most Canadians. Finally, the point on imaginary friend, might be a little far-fetched, but it would be fine to leave if you see fit. Great work overall!   

Thanks for the tips Shannon. I used them all! The interlingual suggestions was perfect!   23:""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I understand what you mean, but there has been a misunderstanding (my fault for sure). I didn't call """"ignorant"""" in the same meaning of """"moron"""". A person with an IQ < 60 is hopeless; an ignorant can always learn. I explained that I attributed to """"ignorant"""" a very specific meaning, that of being unaware, not knowing. Which I don't see as an insult in itself: I am myself ignorant of an incredible amount of things (while, instead, I don't think to be a moron, while I know I can have poor judgement from time to time). As to make the encyclopedia poorer, well, I think they do it in good faith, but they nevertheless do it. Yes, I understand it sounded insulting, and I should have kept a cooler head after TT's remark. But I thought to have been clear.

""""Hindutva"""" as defined by Savarkar baguely means Indian nationalism that draws its 'inspiration' from Hindu/Maratha culture. It cant be called Hindu extremism is broadest sense, largely since Hindu fundamentalism is an oxymoron moreover, founding fathers of Hindutva were Agnostic Hindus. Hindutva rose as a complementary movement to Marathi cultural resurgence (all founders were Marathis (specifically Marathas and Konkanastha Brahmins and till 1970's most memebers of RSS were Marathis). Hindutva in these days is a vague ideology. It differs from one propounded by Savarkar to the one practised by 'parties' like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal.

my opinion
i believe knoledge as such should be neutral. any knoledge can be used for good or evil, and has therefor no conection to one or another value.  you can cualify intention, and use of knoledge. but not knoledge itself. look at the definition of encyclopedia """"comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge..."""" to take out any part of the knoledge would be against the main nature of it. to impose a value of evil, or even a value of good into knoledge would  remove its natural imparciality and therefor its aproach to the truth. 
is the atomic energy bad becouse one can do bombs with it? or good becouse one can have energy with it? or even then bad becouse one gets terrible wastes from it?...knoledge should be and will always be NEUTRAL. and in my opinion free and to the hand of everyone. so that we know weather we do good or evil by our own moral measure, and not just becouse we didnt knew.

Reading the above and looking at the editing history, it seems to me that the whole issue turns on whether  accepts the concept of the analogue signal requirement of being continuous or not.  Since I am an engineer in the Aerospace industry, I though I would draw an analogy from that industry, that illustrated the point.  I was surprised to find that the analogy was turned on its head as will be revealed.  Every reference book I checked made the point that the analog signal had to be continuous (It was even in my Uni notes).  But to the analogy.  

The Harrier aircraft uses mechanical wire linkages from the joystick to the control surfaces (elevator, ailerons & rudder).  This is, of course unarguably an analogue signalling system.  The wire linkage forms a continuous signal, and the control surfaces move in smooth continuous steps.

The Typhoon aircraft, in contrast, uses a digital system.  The position of the pilot's joystick is digitised into a number which gets mashed around a bit by a computer.  The resultant digital signal is then fed to the control surface via what is essentially a stepper hydraulic system.  Both the signals and the movement of the control surfaces are described in all the manuals as digital, in spite of the bit size of the numbers being large enough that the movement may appear to be smooth to the pilot.

The surprise was that in the preamble notes (the part of the manual given to new starters as part of their training), the operation of the digital control contained an explanetary analogy where the system was likened to """"... a clock with analogue hands where the movement of the hands is in fact discontinuous and hence, not really analogue at all.""""

In the subject context, the movement of the hands on a clock that has discontinuous movement (i.e. the majority of clocks) is not analogue and  is wrong to continue to insist that it is.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

And, this Korean is repeating harassment to the ancient history of Japan.

1. """"百濟國主照古王 以牡馬壹疋 牝馬壹疋 付阿知吉師以貢上"""" 
The document of this China was rewritten to an opposite meaning by . 

The meaning of """"貢上"""" is """"dedicated"""".However, he rewrote """"dedicated"""" in """"granted"""". 
The meaning of """"granted"""" is """"下賜"""".

 did a similarly wrong translation, and ruined Imperial House of Japan. 
 said. the 30th Japanese emperor Bidatsu was also a Korean. The section has many potential to be expanded indeed, so what is your rationale?

He translated """"大原真人 出自謚敏達孫百済王也"""". (Quotation 新撰姓氏録) into """"大原真人 is Korean emperor(百済王) Bidatsu(敏達)'s grandchild"""". Of course, Appletrees's translation is completely wrong. A correct translation is """"大原真人 is a descendant of the grandchild """"百済王"""" of emperor Bidatsu(敏達)"""". 

 2. Korean civilization 
""""The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern"""" P56  is being written. 
Via these Korean contacts, Japan opened her doors to continental culture and Chinese civilization. This also enabled direct contacts with China. 

And, """"JapaneseHistory.info""""  is being written. 
Chinese and Korean immigrants played an important role in introducing Chinese civilization to early Japan.

Though a Korean civilization was not written at all, He rewrote, """"A Korean civilization introduced the culture to Japan"""". 

 often misinterprets the source. 
For instance Shakuhachi 

""""Diplomatic and cultural exchanges between Chinese continent and Japan being common, we can think that this flute was introduced in Japan with other musical instruments that were intended to give entertainments at the court (Gagaku; court music).""""

This source is not writing Korea at all. However, he rewrote it. 
""""The bamboo flute first came to Japan from China via Korea. The shakuhachi proper, however, is quite distinct from its Chinese and Korean ancestors, the result of centuries of isolated evolution in Japan.

Here is the content of the Monoplane article from Britannica.  It's not an initial.
Monoplane,  type of aircraft with a single pair of wings. The monoplane design has been nearly universally adopted over multiplane configurations because airflow interference between adjacent wings reduces efficiency. The first monoplane was constructed by the Romanian inventor Trajan Vuia, who made a flight of 12 m (40 feet) on March 18, 1906. Louis Blériot of France built a monoplane in 1907 and flew it across the English Channel two years later. Monoplane design proved itself conclusively during World War II, and since then the craft has completely supplanted the biplane except for special purposes. Compare biplane  Best regards.

New copyedit
Arre, I did a revision checking for sources related to each paragraph. I also tried to get the style more academic:

I added: 
 The article is structured as per Wikipidia manual of style. Created section titles. There's now an intro, a history and conditions sections. 
 Gave context to the article by linking the prison to the political life. 
 In the history section gave a better explanation of the existance of the prison by linking it to the failed coup d'état. Also added info about Mon ami le Roi book. Without a history section, the article reader would find no context to follow.
 I added  to the Saharawi inmates. 
 Added Years of lead as a see also as both subjects are related.

I removed:
 capacity for only 56 inmates. Not true. The reference given   talks about getting 56 detainees for the first time.
 summary executions occurred. In the reference we had , there is no such claim. The article puts it as a possibility. 
 The Al-Ahram weekly reference is about the book of Tahar Ben Jelloun and I put if on further readings and kept the link.
 Scorpions and snakes. I removed snakes as Al Jazeera link only reports scorpions.
 feracious is an adjective and by nature we avoid using adjectives in wikipedia in order to avoid pov issues. Cold winter is enough. 
 Surviving inmates have described the experience as """"being buried alive"""" is not well sourced. They may describe it in all possible words but weather someone said explicitly and exactly being buried alive or not, nobody is sure. I also removed a """"death camp"""" rather than a prison for the same reason while I believe that someone would have said it. But again, no sure. In case of statements declared by people, we have to be very carefull. 
 Approximately half of those imprisoned in Tazmamart eventually succumbed to diseases, torture or simply the winter cold, is removed because it is tackled in the same section. Duplidation.

Consider the background to Mtking and Newmanoconnor immediately agreeing to your no-AfD proposal. Just a week ago they wouldn't have even given you the time of day. The current situation has them very scared and they'll pretty much do anything do anything to fast-track their terrible plan through. This is why they're talking 1-2 week timelines whereas before they've been been screwing with the MMA community for months with an incomplete doc while AfD'ing everything in sight. Of course, short-tracking necessarily means they'll railroad the MMA voices against. If they don't get the short-track, their plan is essentially dead, which is why they'll show a tiny bit of leeway in the short term to get what they want in the long term. What's most notable is that even if they get what they want, it doesn't mean they don't AfD again right after they get approval. Their plan has no brightline rules, and it's vague and open to interpretation (which is why AfD are effective now). The situation after will be no better, but we'll be stuck with it while they're not saddled with anything.

Hi, thanks for email. I deleted your article because 
it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts and show that it meets the notability guidelines. Sources that are not acceptable include those linked to the company, social media and other sites that can be self-edited, blogs, websites of unknown or non-reliable provenance, and sites that are just reporting what the company claims or interviewing its management. Your references where all linked to the company, no independent sources. The claim that would make it notable, the number of downloads, has no independent verification.
it was written in a promotional tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. The list of features is entirely unsurced, and makes unsubstantiated claims like ''this is one of the most used features in APUS Launcher... According to APUS(!), it can intelligently push useful information like weather, traffic, etc. to users.

Your edits indicate that you have an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to editing articles about this subject. Thank you for declaring your interest. If, after reading the information about notability linked above, you still believe that your organisation is notable enough for a Wikipedia article (and that there is significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources), you could, if you wish, post a request at Wikipedia:Requested articles for the article to be created. See also Wikipedia:Best practices for editors with conflicts of interest.

 The nature of your edits also gives the impression you have a financial stake in promoting a topic. Paid advocacy is a category of conflict of interest (COI) editing that involves being compensated by a person, group, company or organization to use Wikipedia to promote their interests. Paid advocacy is prohibited by our policies on neutral point of view and what Wikipedia is not, and is an especially egregious type of COI; the Wikimedia Foundation regards it as a black hat practice.Paid advocates are very strongly discouraged from direct article editing, and should instead propose changes on the talk page of the article in question if an article exists, and if it does not, from attempting to write an article at all. At best, any proposed article creation should be submitted through the articles for creation process, rather than directly.Regardless, if you are receiving or expect to receive compensation for your edits, you are required by the Wikimedia Terms of Use to disclose your employer, client and affiliation. You can post such a mandatory disclosure to your user page at User:. The template  can be used for this purpose – e.g. in the form:  {{paid|user=|employer=InsertName|client=InsertName}}.

First of all, a necessary preamble: consonants in Italian can be double or single, as is well known; however, what is often overlooked in this description is that this contrast can only occur in certain positions, i.e. in between vowels or between a vowel and a """"semivowel"""" (/w/ and /j/) or, for plosives, between a vowel and """"r""""/""""l""""; in all other position all consonants have an indeterminate length. So in the word """"pasto"""" (""""meal"""") neither the """"s"""" nor the """"t"""" can be described as being """"single"""" or """"double"""", they have an intermidiate, indeterminate length (pronouncing something like """"passto"""" or """"pastto"""" would be meaningless in Italian phonology, unlike other languages featuring geminate consonants like Finnish). So, applying this concept to the pronunciation of """"r"""": single """"r"""" is pronounced as a flap, double and indeterminate """"r"""" are pronounced as a trill in standard pronounciation; for example """"caro"""" (dear) contains a flap, while """"terra"""" (earth) and """"treno"""" (train) both contain a trill. You can check this listening to the entries of the """"Dizionario di Ortografia e Pronuncia"""", published by the Italian state television RAI and which is (or used to be) available on this page. Using the trill in """"caro"""", no matter how short, would inevitably turn it into """"carro"""" (charriot). 
I am a native speaker, I've taught Italian to foreigners and I have studied and compared Italian phonology in depth. Of course, this claims are not sufficient for wikipedia, but there's an inherent problem when referencing publications on the subject. For long time phonology has been considered in Italy just a lesser part of grammar; more importantly, most study focussed on internal controversies and variations, i.e. describing the language from within the language, a more objective and scientific study of the phonetics is quite limited. It suffices to say that even IPA has hardly ever been used in the description of Italian phonetics, many authors using custom phonetic conventions even in promimenent works (such as the one I linked before). This means that while the contrast between /e/ and /ɛ/ or /ɔ/ and /o/ is widely discussed in many pubblication because there's a lot of variation in distribution, little work can be found about other distinctive traits of Italian phonology that are uniform or nearly so among native speakers (e.g. the assimilation of place of articulation of """"n"""" with the following consonant; the lengthening of the vowel in stressed, open syllables inside words; phonetic value of syllables like in /pas.to/ contrasting with the prescribed orthographic split """"pa-sto"""", syllable-timed rythm, etc.). The difference of distribution of flap vs trill for """"r"""", as well as an accurate description of consonants of incontrastive length in general, has been largely disreguarded.

 Peter Birks 

Dear Legis

I have had to revert most of the edits made to the article Peter Birks because they were virtually indistinguishable from Jack Beatson, 'Peter Birks' (Obituary), The Guardian (16 July 2004), accessed 18 August 2009. You appear to be the editor who was responsible for reproducing a large quantity of copyright material in this article. I am surprised to find this kind of editing being done by a lawyer with a first-class degree. Just to show to what an extent you had plagiarised the material, compare:

He became regius professor of civil law at Oxford University and a fellow of All Souls College in 1989, having held chairs at Edinburgh (1981-87) and, briefly, at Southampton. Before that, he was a tutorial fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford (1971-81), a strong law college to which he remained very close, and taught at University College London.

He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1989, and an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, his undergraduate college, in 1994; ... He was made an honorary Queen's counsel in 1995, and served as president of the Society of Legal Scholars in 2002-03. He lectured and taught throughout the Commonwealth and in Europe. (The Guardian)

Birks, together with Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, was a key figure in the extraordinary development of the law of restitution in the last 45 years. (Your edit)

And so it continues, including the lifting, almost wholesale, of this paragraph:

One example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in Woolwich Building Society v Inland Revenue. This held, for the first time, that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities are not entitled to them. The reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a Birks essay but, possibly because the lawyers had adopted his arguments without attribution, the judgments do not refer to the essay. This was put right in the House of Lords, where Lord Goff described the essay as """"powerful"""". (The Guardian)

One example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in Woolwich Building Society v Inland Revenue. In that case the courts [synonymous with The Guardian's original, 'This'] held, for the first time in English law [you add 'in English law'], that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities had no legal right to levy them [again, synonymous with the original]. The reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a Birks essay but the judgments did not refer to his writing (some critics suggest this was because the lawyers adopted his arguments without attribution) [you move a subordinate clause from the middle of the sentence to the end, varying the wording just slightly]. This was put right in the House of Lords, where Lord Goff described his writings [='the essay'] as """"powerful"""". (Your edit)

You copy a bit more copyright material, and at the end of the article even clumsily leave in, '· Peter Brian Herrenden Birks, academic lawyer, born October 3 1941; died July 6 2004'.

Disappointing editing from a highly educated member of the legal profession.

Portal:Architecture
Hello, are you interested in rotating the Portal every third week? 

Very nice pictures of Barcelona. May I nominate some for featured picture at Commons? Thanks  

You're right that it always needs updating in many ways. Don't forget also DYK and in the news (in the news we sadly seem to neglect the most). It would be nice to even rotate the SI and SAs on a shorter than 1 week basis sometime, I don't know if were ready for that yet even though we have something of a backlog developing in the nominations. What do you think of this, Hallidie Building? I found a picture for it finally, and need to substantiate the claim about the first curtain wall. I forget where I read that, but know I did somewhere. Once I remember and add a little more, it might be my first DYK. Best, + R/W

Thanks! You can rotate the portal tonight, if you'd like to, or I'll get to it tomorrow, since I delayed two weeks now. — 

mosque to house
I think that will be more accurate. it's a pilgrimage site therefore a shrine... the use of mosque in the ref is used not in accurate fashion.  

Pilgrimage site and worship site. It is more accurately a worshiping site and muslims come from all over the world to visit it as it is one of the 3 holiest sites. Maybe having it Mosque for worship is enough and fair along with the word shrine.  

house of pilgrimage. if not, it's best to leave it. almaqdisi, stop stalking.  

I do not undersand. Mginnly is saying that there are many sources which mention it is a Mosque. This is true. Now you are discussing it is for piligrimage or worship. Pointless. Keep the word a Mosque only if pilgrimage will be an issue of debate too! No need to mention piligrimage or worship, just a mosque. And accroding  to the definition of a Mosque, it is a place of worship. In Mecca the piligrims go to worship in a Mosque called masjid al-Haram. But again, if this is an issue of debate, forget it and just keep the word Mosque along with the word shrine. Simple...  
it's by definition not a mosque. some refer to it as mosque because of pilgrimage. No, the article will never say in the lead that it's a """"mosque"""" because it isn't. Live with it.  

Alternate version will be to leave """"shrine"""" and in the end of the lead say something like """"Some refer to the Dome as a Rock as a mosque even though it isn't"""". That can be acceptable too.  

Amuros, please let us not repeat the stuff we did in several talk pages...! Any one can go to Google and find """"Dome of the Rock Mosque"""" or """"Mosque of Umar"""" to see that this is indeed a Mosque.! I will stop discussing this any further.

Okay, it is stated eventually, but not until the geometry section, and there only in the abstract language of linear algebra, putting the main point of rotation matrices out of reach of anyone except those who should know it already.

In the section Levellers#Origin_of_name there is the following text:
´´It first appeared in print in a book written by Charles I called 'His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration', first sold around 15 November 1647.´´
On the 11th of November 1647 the King Charles R send a message to the Speaker of the House of Lords in which he talks about the Levellers, this is a letter in which he states that he is forced to flee from Hampton Court. The King arrived on the Isle of Wight on the 14th and stays with the Governor Robert Hammond. And as the King was effectively being held a prisoner by Colonel HammondCharles_I_of_England#English_Civil_war long after the 16th. 
Which made me wonder who started selling the book, and whether the book was sold despite or because of the tumult. As this all occurs in between the First English Civil War, which ended May of 1646, and the Second English Civil War. Naturally at the time 'His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration' was published there was no foresight that predicted the Second English Civil War, but it might be considered slightly inflammatory. And although I don't doubt the book is genuine, it is plain that Charles I had little to do with the sale as he was on the Isle of Wight.

Thanks for your kind words about my comments. I'd disagree, though. I'm not convinced that GoRight was, exactly, baiting WMC, he was, more accurately, confronting some clear double standards. The edits which got him blocked for harassment were echoes of what WMC had said, and which had been supported by, as I recall, Schulz. Whether it was true or not, those comments were set up, GoRight just noticed it and said it, violating User:Abd/Rule 0. I'd call it uncivil, but on a scale not worse than what had preceded it, and certainly, because of it's mirror nature, more just.

I've tried to reach out to Connolley, but he rejected it, which is sad. I suspect that he's a good man who has fallen into some bad company. (Maybe they are all good men who have fallen into a bad constellation, some pattern that reinforces the worst aspects of the way they are working here.) The incivility serves no obvious good purpose from any POV except one that would hate the project to be successful, and I'm sure that's not Connolley's POV.

In any case, I have not denied the uncivil aspects of GoRight's edits, I've merely noted that they are easily explainable as a natural response to what clearly appeared to him to be an abusive cabal, and what he was seeing confirmed what was in the Solomon source. I believe that he is now able to see beyond that, and that he's learned to not make accusations that involve assumptions of bad faith. I draw a distinction between noting a reasonable suspicion that something is off, and claiming that it is off. I might note that a user shows characteristics of a block-evading sock, but I won't claim that the user is a block-evading sock unless I'm prepared to back it up with sufficiently solid evidence. I'll only state the former, as well, the suspicion, if the suspicion is clearly reasonable, so I'd just be stating the obvious, which sometimes must be said.

And that's how I've treated sock puppetry charges against me: if there was some reasonable basis, not matter how shallow, I didn't charge abusive SSP filing. GoRight clearly went too far, but he didn't keep it up. Meanwhile, he was blocked in outrageous violation of block policy, and I'm mulling over whether or not I should do anything about that. Baley has denied that there was any error in the block, and this is what actually might make it necessary to go for an RfC. It's pretty clear, it's not marginal. But, of course, RfC isn't the first step. The first step would be something like what I just did on User talk:William M. Connolley. The next step, for me, would be to attempt to identify someone Connolley might trust, to give him a friendly nudge. Has to be a friend, not merely an ally.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Email haxing 

Some random dude did an article drive by here and got a bee up his butt and decided to start tearing stuff up without even bothering to talk to anybody about it fist or justifying it what so ever.  I don't know if he is trying to white wash the article or is meat puppeting for someone else who's been trying to white wash here in the past.  I just do not know.  But I see the distruction he has caused and I weep.  No, not really.  But it is pretty lame nonetheless.

So why is this stuff in here?  Well some guy haxed her emails and cell phones - just like he did with 50 other celebrities.  He haxed and stole all kinds of extremely sexually explicit photographs.  So now the haxer dude gets caught and the Fed want a 60 year sentence.  But they back down to a 6 yr one.  But, the random haxer dude has got to pay Rene, my sweet, dear, poor Rene over $76,000 in """"restitution.""""  This is for about 20 pics of Rene stuffing a dildo in every hole of her body.

The Feds worked on this case for nearly a year and talked to more than 50 haxing victims.

But you, Mr. Random Dude, by wandering in here on a drive by and white washing, you denigrate Rene's status as an innocent victim here.  You are telling the world that We - Wikipedia - could careless about how you have been so wrongly injured that we are just going to bury the truth like it never happened.

This event was an extremely signifant event for her and her life will never be the same afterwards (or, it won't be the same till she cashes her $76,000 check, eh?).

So, Mr. Random dude white washer, what have you to say to justify your actions?  Oh, and please don't come back with some kind of lame responce like, """"Well, I have been here longer and I am going to throw my Wiki weight around and you got to do what I say because I am King of the Wiki Hill here or I will ban you, etc., etc..""""

Prameswara is indeed a common Sanskrit name. Prameswara is also incontrovertibly Indonesian, whether he was Sumatran or Javanese  is unclear- but he was definitely born in Sumatra int the court of Sriwijaya- not as the article states, in Temasek- which would make Prameswara a fisherman's child.
Islam arrived in Indonesia from Persia, Punjab and Gujarat- not China. Zheng He was a Hamafi muslim, not a Sufi. The earliest Muslim graves in Java proper date from 1368 (Banten) -1400 in Trowulan, the capital of Majapahit in the same complex as the cenetries of the highest nobility- which indicates the highest strata of Javanese society had already began to convert, predating the Eunuch Turkoman Hamafi Zheng He. Thus the ludicrous argument CHinese as part of the Wali Songo brought Islam to Java is disproved by archeological evidence.

You will also note- the Javanese repelled the Mongols- the only other Asians to successfully do so were the Japanese. Zheng He's navy was a navy for prestige and tribute- not a military navy. The Javanese under Singhasari later Majapahit also repelled the Siamese, and the Negerakertagama epoic already indicates there was Muslim activity or unrest in pre-Zheng He Java.

Thanks for the input! I will correct the URLs and the terminology tomorrow. I was under the impression Solus Operating System was a Linux distro and not to be confused with what has a page on here called SolusOS - are you that same project? If not, which I think is the case, I can set it up so this page redirects to a new page with the same article (blanking this one) called Solus Operating System, so long as that is available. If you would prefer right now to not have a Wikipedia article I`ll gladly comply with your wish. Some organizations don` t really want to be on Wikipedia for various reasons. Anyway, I am enjoying your OS. If you get around to it could explain to me what makes Solus its own OS rather than a Linux distro? Also, I understood that although you use Budgie, Gnome is behind it. When I look at """"details"""" in Solus it says Gnome 3.x.x )    Also my name is being changed to SpiffyAnarchist, fyi.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello Ckatz. I noticed that you deleted my link from the External Links section of the wikipedia entry on Salt Spring Island. I am curious as to why you did this as it is the most valuable online resource pertaining to Salt Spring Island that is available. The only searchable clickable street index for one thing,and also the map is the only source for info pertaining to hiking trails, routes and trailheads on Salt Spring Island. The map found at http://www.mapofsaltspring.com/mapofsaltspring.pdf is, in fact, the most encycopedic source of info pertaining to avian and marine life in and around the island also.

Please let me know why you did this.

I can't believe how you people run this place. WTF is wrong with you? There were 5 different linked sites that provided help on the Da Vinci Code webquests - 2 were for the original webquest and those links had been here on Wikipedia for several years without issue and were the most well-used resources for the webquests on the internet, and then 3 more links were recently added for help with the NEW Google webquests that just started this month. NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all, and do NOT superced them in any manner. ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests (and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests), and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new, and replaces them with his own link, and when several site owners try to put their information back up, this clown repeatedly deletes it ..and then you mods back him up??? WTF is up with that??? PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS??? Your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests, and only one link for help with the new webquest, which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefact.blogspot.com. Oh wait, there's one more link too, and that's to his mirror site at davinciquest.blogspot.com. How can you justify your actions?

If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand, but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done, nor has anyone offered any.

Once that is done, the superfluous material can be weeded out, and perhaps, just perhaps, one ends up with an article about parallel myths, which can then be appropriately retitled so it more accurately represents the topic actually dealt with, which presently is a series of analogous or parallel myths to such myths as virgin birth, son of God, resurrection, miraculous cures, etc.  Note carefully that I'm not making an assertion whether these primarily scriptural stories are accurate or not.

Strange. I was almost sure that Karen Ryan is a pen name of William Mauco, as part of the article Igor Smirnov, Pridnestrovie's Khozyain president from """"Tiraspol Times"""" is copied word-by-word from the article Khozyain from Wikipedia, which was writen by William Mauco. Only after that was discovered started Mauco to write """"officially"""" in TIraspol Times with the name William Maurice. Comparison:

Wikipedia's Khozyain, stub written by Mauco 21 July 2006: Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader. It is rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain. Russians tend to judge leaders, including politicians, on whether they are (or give the impression of being) a real khozyain. They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. A person who displays talents in this direction is called a khozyaistvennik. A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context. A more accurate description would be to classify him as a father figure. Examples of khozyain politicians: Yuri Luzhkov and Igor Smirnov.

article in Tiraspol Times by Karen Ryan, 11 September 2006, part """"The Khozyain president"""": Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader; the prototype of the style of Igor Smirnov, Pridnestrovie's own """"Khozyain"""" head of state. It is a rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain. Russian voters judge leaders, including politicians, on whether they are (or give the impression of being) a real khozyain. They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. Igor Smirnov and the other founding fathers of the republic have declared on many occasions, from the earliest day of the independence struggle, that what they wanted to create was a society free of """"isms."""" A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context, and, true to form, Igor Smirnov has been called both a """"strongman"""" and, by the more radical Smirnov-haters in Moldova, a """"dictator"""". A more accurate description, for those who understand the true meaning of the word khozyain, would be to classify him as a father figure.

What is sure is that Mauco is pushing everywhere in Wikipedia Tiraspol Times, not only here but in any Transnistria-related page. In an other article he was against the linking to a Russian press agency, he started edit war to include his beloved TT. Probabily he has good reasons for loving it, but I'm still confused: who is William Mauco, William Maurice or Karen Ryan? """,0,0,0,0,0,0

What were you ranting about?

Are you talking to me, or the 300+ people who've downloaded this refutation of you and your uncivil friends?: http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

And Joshua also said:

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

Wow you sure like to weasel-word: """"other issues""""? What are you references for this vague """"other issues"""" JoshuaZ the Policy Master of Wikpedia?

And Joshua, who said anything about prophecies? Where did Starfire777 say anothing about prophecies? No JoshuaZ the wannabe scholar, he said """"predicted"""" in the same way that science can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment. If your lazy-brained truth-careless self had been paying attention to what he said CARE FULL Y you might have noticed that the verses were using PAST TENSE JOSHUA, not FUTURE TENSE JOSHUA.

History and Giving Context for Atlanta Demographics - adding numbers to population chart
While Fulton County did not encompass all of what is in the Atlanta SMSA today, I think it is misleading to provide only Atlanta City population numbers in the mid-19th c. While it was established as a railroad terminus, it didn't exist by itself.

In 1860 Fulton County had a total of 14,427 people.  There were 2955 enslaved African-Americans, 20.5% of the population.  While much of north GA had mostly yeoman farmers, both Cobb and Fulton County also had planters (defined by historians as holding 20 or more slaves), who held slaves for labor on large cotton plantations. 

(I know more about Roswell in Cobb county, than Fulton, but the origins of major planters and the slaves they brought with them are likely similar. Roswell King and planters he invited to join him in his enterprise (at what became Roswell) were from the coast. King brought 36 slaves from his coastal plantation and bought another 42 at Darien, GA, to take with him to work on building his house, the mill, and supporting buildings. Archibald Smith brought 36 slaves with him from his coastal plantations in St. Marys County and created a 300-acre cotton plantation in Roswell. King's idea was to have cotton production AND  processing in the same place. The forced migration of slaves from the coast to north GA meant they brought their unique Geechee culture and language with them.  Where slaves were held in larger numbers on plantations, it's likely they kept their culture and traditions going.) 

Atlanta and Fulton County in fact more than doubled in population from 1860 to 1870. People rushed to rebuild the city.  In a pattern typical of other areas, many newly freed African-Americans left plantations to move to town to work at trades or crafts, to have safety in numbers and to try to set up lives apart from white control.  

By 1870 Fulton County had grown to 33,446 people.  Among them were 15,282 """"colored"""", as defined by the census, 45.7% of the population. 

NOTEWORTHY CITIZENS: Atlanta boasts two Nobel Prize winners: Rev. Martin Luther King, the youngest man to receive the Nobel Prize, and President Jimmy Carter.  Each were awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.

 Nonsense song titles 

Thanks for starting List of English songs whose title includes nonsense-words. I'd been offhandedly collecting some nonsense song titles against the possibility that such a list would spring into being. —  (talk) 
Great. btw: My experience is that just starting a list is a good place to store any beginning collection. Here it grows wonderfully and wikifully. (I also started: List of songs containing the name of a ship, aircraft or spacecraft. With only three entries).
Now I'm gonna take a look. Bye, -

Thank you very much for your hard work with the Dutch songs, you've done it much quicker than it would have taken me.  

 Edits to List of songs over fifteen minutes in length 

Hi. Your improvement attempts are appreciated, but please see its talk page about the big question of possible formats and further use of this page's raw data. For instance, your deleting the author on the first six entries for Klaus Schulze, or the Zappa entries, doesn't work with the proposal, nor most reuses of the list – even if a different line format is eventually choosen, a consistent list with all data (album, date, author) will be easier to automatically reformat to something else using regular expressions, macros, and/or scripts.

(Furthermore, I found out the list's original 'author' (initiator) talk 
I'll react on the talk page. Reverting all my edits in the article is OK.-

To all Wikipedia Editors of the Jehovah's Witnesses pages: 

FOR THE RECORD: I have chosen to not respond directly to Central's continued personal attacks on myself as that is quite obviously a pointless exercise in futility. Nevertheless, I felt an explanation might be in order for anyone else contributing to these pages. As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are generally a logical fallacy. By the same reasoning anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue, which is what should be included in the  Critical of the Group section. This has been discussed at length above. And, although we clearly we're not able to reach a unanimous agreement on the content, we did attain a majority consensus from those of the current contributors to this page that cared to express an opinion regarding what this section should and should not contain. Anyone that is curious can read the above thread whichas  has observedis """"quite prolonged"""". That being said, I welcome any and all reasonable dialogue on the subject. But as long as Central continues his personal attacks on my character I will continue to undo his reverts without further comment.

 From previous posts, learned that page direction was for terminology, not necessarily biology. But added more succinct genetic information citation to definition, making the body of the text heavier.  Added short biology section because of this.
 Found more usage of the term """"black sheep.""""

Getaway: Thank you for your comments. I most certainly did give my reasons  Read my previous comment. What you didn't do is raise any points on the discussion page before making changes. As for your charges:

1) FAIR and Media Matters are certainly media watchdogs, even though they're political. All media watchdogs are political. Rush Limbaugh is political. That doesn't make any of their views invalid, but it does call for balance. 

2) Phrases like """"axe to grind"""" serve no function in intelligent debate. It would be equally pointless to argue that Limbaugh has an """"axe to grind."""" He does, and I don't have a problem with that. He has every right to have an axe to grind here in the land of free speech, and so do FAIR and Media Matters. Having an axe to grind is just one way to say somebody takes a certain political position. Limbaugh's positions are one POV of a partisan debate and FAIR's are another. Their axes, excuse me, their views need to be balanced. By the way, I don't know as much about Media Matters as about FAIR, but FAIR makes no claim to be """"neutral and nonpartisan"""" as you suggest. What they claim is to be accurate. You're welcome to challenge that accuracy, with sources. Which leads to my next point:

3) It's very easy to toss out weasel words like """"MM and FAIR both have long records of inaccuracy"""" but you're not providing any evidence that their charges against Limbaugh are fallacious or inaccurate. Judging from Limbaugh's feeble response to FAIR's charges, we might be tempted to conclude that Limbaugh can't answer FAIR because FAIR got it right. If there's a problem with FAIR's accuracy, you're welcome to include it, with sources, in the paragraph. (I've issued this invitation three times already and nobody has taken me up on it.) But you do not get to blindly assert that FAIR isn't a credible source without any evidence to back you up, and you don't get to water down what I've written just because you don't like FAIR's work or because you can't find sources to back up your position.

4) FAIR isn't merely expressing opinion. It's documenting errors of fact. Please don't confuse opinion with fact, they're not the same thing at all. When Limbaugh claims that suspending rules on minority hiring will make earthquake repairs go quickly, he's stating an opinion. But when Limbaugh says the government suspended rules on minority hiring, he's making a statement of fact. FAIR is taking issue with Limbaugh's facts. 

5) I'm not asking for special treatment for FAIR. I'm asking that, as per NPOV rules, their view get equal treatment. Are you asking for special treatment for Limbaugh's views? 

6) Please focus on substance? I am. I feel it's important to provide a historical perspective on this controversy, and I feel the article needs to illustrate of the depth and scope of the controversy, which is provided by the Media Matters quote. I also feel this section needs a defining introductory sentence. For these reasons, I'm restoring much of the previous text. If you disagree, please take issue with me on this page. 

BTW I feel that Allen3 made a useful clarifying edit in an earlier revision, when he labeled FAIR a """"progressive"""" organization, and provided a link to an article. I find that much more accurate than """"Liberal,"""" since FAIR keeps its distance from classic liberalism, and sometimes takes issue with people who call themselves Liberal.

*  *  *

I look at a lot of articles (such as BillCJ and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 - lots and lots of facts boring, dull uninteresting pictures - picture with no history surrounding what is being published.  In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.

This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.

Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.

It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state """" Gee an F-16 in Flight """" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article """"Aircraft is on a bomb-run"""" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...

BillCJ also mentioned """" are you seriously suggesting that """" serious historians """" only read WP articles for the pictures? """" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual"""" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.

It is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then 
 why have technical specifications
 why have details on each variation??  
 Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user??
 Etc, Etc, Etc...
Why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).

If we dumbdown the photocaptions for the """"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the """" casual reader """" and will lead to people calling all such information """" gobbledy-gook """".

If we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information """" gobbledy-gook to most readers """" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are """"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers""""

BillCJ has also mentioned that Wiki is not the place for F-16 Buff's to write article - This is complete opposite what the founders of wiki wanted when this project (wikipedia as a whole) dreamed many, many years ago - Wiki w",0,0,0,0,0,0

I have no idea how I can be expected to prove a negative here!

I had already known that Lancombz was behind the same firewall because he is indirectly responsible for my getting involved with Wikipedia.  However, we have only a slight acquaintance and it is not a relationship of equals, making it difficult for me to compel him to do anything at all.  Furthermore, he left Wikipedia in a huff weeks ago over the behavior of the very same people now hounding me.  When I contacted him earlier today to ask for his advice and assistance, he only insisted that Wikipedia was corrupt, incompetent and a waste of his time.  He used less polite words than that, making it clear that the matter was closed, as he saw it.

I do not know who FreddyTris is, and though """"Fred"""" is a common name, it is not to be found around here.  I do not see much chance of his aiding me because he is an ardent Objectivist and has shown an active disdain for Wikipedia administration, to the point where he caught Mr. Wolfer in a 3RR violation but chose not to report it.

There is an atmosphere of a witch hunt here and the matter is spiraling out of control.  ,  and some anonymous user have all defaced my user page.  This has also taken place on Freddy's page and Lan's, both with suspiciously anonymous users joining in.  Otheus has demanded that Lancombz apologize and make promises, but of course this requires Lan to return to Wikipedia, which I doubt will ever occur.

The attacks include a number of malicious revert wars outside of user pages.  Mike has reverted Freddy's edit of Ayn Rand with a dishonest comment and is clearly taunting him.  It appears to be working, given Freddy's angry responses.  Along with , Mike is doing much the same on Objectivism (Ayn Rand), leaving intentionally false edit comments.  I fully expect Freddy to lose his temper and go amok at any moment.  The locus of this insanity is , where they are spinning tales linking me to still other users.  They started with , but are now trying to expand it to   and perhaps others.

What we have here is a group of users trying to take over all of the articles related to Ayn Rand, using intimidation, administrator manipulation and outright deceit to get their way.  Lan might have been short-tempered, but he was clearly not delusional. At this point, I am frustrated and disgusted by the state of affairs and want only for this foolishness to come to an end.  Can you do something about this?

So we're back at the point we were before - is there something special about the relationship between Hagos and Biasutti that allows this transfer of expertise just by citation? My point is that it takes years of training, experience and recognition by others in the field to be considered an expert in that field. You seem to be saying Hagos got it just by citing Biasutti. If David Attenborough cited Niels Bohr would he become an expert in Physics? No he wouldn't, he'd just be an expert in biology who happened to cite an expert in physics once - we wouldn't be able to accept anything he said about quantum mechanics or block holes as fact until we checked it with a genuine expert in the field. So what makes you think Hagos has become an expert in human skin colour just by citing Biasutti? And remember that the policy doesn't just state """"expert"""",  it states """"established expert in the topic whose previous work in the field has been published by reliable third-party publications"""" - unless you are you going to argue that Hagos got Biasutti's reputation and previous publications as well I think this is a dead end argument. You should accept that Hagos doesn't meet the criteria laid down by the WP policy for the creators of self-published sources.
If you don't think that Hagos chose the colours for each country then who do you think did it? They didn't just magically change due to """"migration trends"""" - somebody made a decision that colour X goes in country Y. From the evidence we have it would appear that Hagos was the one who made that decision - it certainly wasn't made by Biasutti or the writers of the national census data that he cites as his sources.
It makes no difference to the situation so I won't argue it, but for the record I don't accept that Hagos is a recognised expert on migration.

While I agree that this article isn't FA material, I must suggest that your added criticism in the lead is also repetitive.  The SPLC's opinion of the show is referenced throughout.  At the very least, your edit should be amended to read that The Political Cesspool has hosted FORMER members of the Ku Klux Klan. In fact, the only one I can find for sure is David Duke, who has also been interviewed by every major talk radio and television program in the country.  (Perhaps it should read, """"a former member of the Ku Klux Klan."""")  Furthermore, Duke was in the Klan in the 1970's, nearly three decades before The Political Cesspool first went on the air.  Does Wolf Blitzer's Wiki entry read that he has hosted Klan members?  Duke has appeared on Blitzer's show.

There are already many people who feel that this article is flagrantly biased.

I hold the science of physics to be the following: the endeavour to account for the whole corpus of observations in a coherent mathematical framework. It all begins with observations, and observations should always be the final word. 

Whenever a principle can be stated in a form that is not committed to any specific theory, it should be stated in that uncommitted form. The Equivalence principle is prime example of that. 

The Harvard tower experiment indicates that there is no clash between quantumphysics and GR as far as measureable aspects of physics are concerned. At present the formal frameworks of the two theories cannot be reconciled, but the measurements agree. 

The principle of relativity of special relativity can be formulated in a theory-committed form, but Einsteins choice of principle is best: in all frames of reference that are not measurably accelerated, measurement of the velocity of electromagnetic radiation will yield the same value.  | Talk 06:30, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hannibal 

Good Article it could use a bit of revising but we can worry about that later. Returning to the discussion about the coint,,,uhhh guys Hannibal is Phoenician(Caanite,Yemen Migrents) Caanite(yemen Migrents Berber(yemen Migrents) Carthaginian Arab

Berbers: 

Berbers are the original and first inhabitants of North-Africa, in other words, they are the natives of this part of Africa. The name by which they are called (berbers) comes from the noun """"barbarians"""" (in english). And this, because Romans used to call All those who didn't speak their language  """"barbarians""""... And actually, there are only us who are still called like this ^_~ why did they use this term, they just use this noun without any feeling of a pejorative meaning. But to call themeselves in their language (Tamazight), they use """"imazighen"""": the plural of """"Amazigh"""". 

Many people ask about our origins, and I always say that this question is sensless! it's like asking what is the origins of the Indians! Indians Don't have the same eyes as chinese but they are considered as asians so Just think about us (it's an order!) that We are berbers Thus we are Africans! 

Don't forget that those who first were called africans were berbers, when you study about Rome and byzantine at school, you've probably heard about carthage and africans? these africans were the great Phoenicians,Berbers (arabs). Hence the Carthaginian Arabs. 

But we can answer to which race the berbers belong to, As you know (I'm sure you don't know!^^') there are 3 races in the world: 

The Caucasoid race (Europeans, Jews/hebrews, Arabs ...etc.) 

The Negroid Race. (Blacks) 

The Mongloid Race. (chinese, japanese ...etc.) 

Berbers are predominately Caucasoid (berbers of the sahara are mixed with sub-saharans), Their language is close to the Language spoken by the old egyptians (Pharaohs...), in other words they speak an Afro-asiatic language (Hebrew, Arab, assyrian, Old egyptian, Berber...etc.) SEMETIC! XD 

To see how berbers look like click google 

To know how berber language sounds (through music) download this MP3 by clicking google 

The lands where berbers lived in the past, were from the west of Old Egypt to the Canary-islands, But now, Berbers constitute only 25% of the population in Algeria and 40% in morocco, the berbers of the canary islands (called guanches) are spanish now and they've lost their language.

Here is the Berber DNA compared to other ethnics: 

""""So far, our analyses have allowed a clear dissection of almost all NW African...paternal lineages into several components with distinct historical origins. In this way, the historical origins of the NW African Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows: 75% NW African Upper Paleolithic (H35, H36, and H38), 13% Neolithic (H58 and H71), 4% historic European gene flow (group IX, H50, H52), and 8% recent sub-Saharan African (H22 and H28)."""" (Bosch et al., Am J Hum Genet, 2001) * * * Caucasoid mtDNA (maternal) sequences, labeled L3E and U6, were detected at frequencies of 96% in Moroccan Berbers, 82% in Algerian Berbers and 78% in non-Berber Moroccans, compared with only 4% in a Senegalese population. (Rando et al., Ann Hum Genet, 1998) * * * 

While the origins of the Sumerians, whose language appears related to no known linguistic family, remain a mystery, the other people of the region were chiefly Semites - Canaanites (the Levant), Amorites (southwestern desert people), Akkadians and Assyrians (Mesopotamia), Arameans, Habiru (Hebrews) and Bedu (Beduin Arabs of the southern desert). The languages of these groups are closely related, and also related more distantly to Hamitic languages, which include ancient Egyptian, Coptic, and Ethiopian.

Throughout the Bronze Age there was a sporadic influx of nomads from Arabia into the area, hostile at first, but soon incorporated into the existing culture. Later, Indo-European peoples migrated into the area. Among them were the Hurrians, who moved from Turkey in the North to Iraq in the 3rd milleneum BCE and brought the light horse-drawn chariot and composite b",0,0,0,0,0,0

CONCLUSIONS 

Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome... Medicines that affect pain perception, sleep, and mood have been useful and should be integrated with activity, exercise, and educational programs. Most patients with FM observed in tertiary referral centers report little change in their symptoms over time. The outcome is directly related to psychosocial factors, including past and current psychological distress and work status or disability issues. As with any chronic illness, patients in the community do better than those observed in specialty clinics. Ten percent to 30% of patients describe being work impaired from FM. Physicians should discourage inactivity and disability because, if these are prolonged, there is an adverse effect on prognosis. Finally, patients have found a diagnostic label to be reassuring, and the diagnosis has decreased costly testing and health care use. ...

That wasn't an attack (ad hominem), that was constructive criticism.  There's a difference.  """"You're an idiot,"""" is an ad hominem attack.  It is a baseless insult with no constructive intention.  """"Rubbish"""" is an ad hominem attack.  There is nothing constructive other than an insult of another contributors work.  Telling fiddle they he or she has an """"arrogant obtuse attitude"""" was constructive with the intention of advice on how to better deal with new posters.  """"Instead of posting rubbish"""" is both an arrogant and insulting statement.  It did nothing to help me create a better article, OR give reasons why the SKK article was being deleted.  """"Rubbish"""" is not an objective criteria.  """"This article has already been posted & debated"""" is.  Of course this fact never was brought up until after the discussion was well out of hand.

Second, you cannot with any intellectual honesty characterize what I posted as """"vandalism.""""  My repeated intention was to make a sincere contribution of a topic that I felt is important.  I was more than happy to discuss the merits of the article as evidenced by my fruitless attempt to use the """"hangon"""" tag.  I literally barely had time to type a few words before the article was again deleted with absolutely zero discussion or valid justification.  

I encourage ALL parties to go back and look at how this played out.  There was NO discussion other than threats & a dismissive suggestion to go play in your own sandbox.  Is this really how you want to run Wiki?  It is, after all, your playground, and you get to make the rules.  That's fine with me.  Maybe you really have dealt with too many vandals, and were quick to lump me in with whatever hooligans you may be used to dealing with.  If I really wanted to be a vandal, I could easily use an ip proxy to keep posting & causing trouble here.  There would be little that you could do about it, but that is not who I am.  I am an honest contributor who took exception to fiddles arrogant and insulting attitude.  We can disagree on that assessment, but don't expect me to get on my knees with some """"gee, I'm sorry"""" obsequiesness just so I can join the cool kids club.

My advice to you is maybe you, fiddle & hiber might reconsider your knee jerk reactions & at least assume positive intent (see """"community"""" heading above) & try a discussion that does not start with something along the lines of """"your work is rubbish.""""   16:42""",0,0,0,0,0,0

f41dad7f70a10f6b,"I think that it is unlikely that good faith is as much of an issue for most of us as is being unconsciously blind to our own biases. It is clear that Rhwentworth is highly invested in NVC, and while he may have a business COI, I think it is more likely he would simply like to protect NVC from what he sees, given his expertise, as unfair criticism. Sunray is more curious. S/he has, in my opinion, been extremely defensive, tendentious and aggressive, having accused several of us of wikilawyering and harboring a hidden agenda against NVC, as well as claiming we had reached consensus when in fact the defenders (mostly me) had simply given up, having felt bulldozed. S/he has also consistently removed material from the criticisms section, because s/he incorrectly assessed the sources, could not find a convenient link to the source, or because the source was deemed inappropriate for criticismyet left the source in place for material elsewhere in the article. I have no idea why Sunray is so aggressive about critiques of NVC, but I doubt it is a COI or bad faith.

The strong objections to the critiques by a number of pro-NVC advocates, such as Sunray and Rhwentworth, essentially consist of the idea that there are no valid criticisms of NVC. In the previous arguments over these sources, the substance of the objection came down to either rejecting the source as unreliable (for criticism but not for promotion) or claiming that the source misunderstands NVC and thus is simply wrong. So at this point, the only critique of NVC we have noted in the article is that it lacks critique. Given the strong and diverse critiques of NVC that have been published, this is sad to me.

I pointed out that disparaging of the sources of criticism of NVC as being unreliable, minority, inaccurate etc. should also apply to the sources supporting NVC. On this talk page, I went through every reference in the article and showed that they were nearly all from promotional or minority literature. It is hard to find traditionally reliable (e.g. academic, peer-reviewed, mainstream, etc.) sources for any aspect of NVC. This has marginally improved.

I suggested previously that we have a responses section rather than a critique or criticisms section, which I hoped would allow some of the responses from non-academic or non-traditional sources to be aired in the article. We have been stuck arguing about the academic sources, however, so I am thinking that the less reliable sources would not be accepted. 

I believe that beyond the argument we are having about sources for explicit criticism of NVC, there are other big issues. The article was originally criticized by editors as sounding promotional, and we made some headway in fixing this. Lately, however, the article has again been rewritten, in my opinion, to promote NVC. This consists of burying information that might cast NVC in a less than glorious light and by making the article essentially a description of how the advocates of NVC see it as working, rather than putting it into a context for naive readers. For example, Sunray argued very strongly that NVC is not a conflict resolution technique, but is a trademark of an organization and therefore should not be criticized under the BLP policy. I then added the information that NVC is trademarked to the intro, but this was removed to the very end of the article. (Perhaps there should be an 'sm' next to each mention of NVC, since it is a trademarked item.) The one study of NVC efficacy described in detail in the article as research was published in a non-peer-reviewed newsletter. This information was removed to the reference section rather than staying in the article itself, where I put it. The fact that there is nearly no discussion, research or confirmation of NVC in the literature was removed from the introduction to become the sole critique of NVC, at the end of the article. And, as one of the sources on NVC notes, one critique of NVC is that it is based on beliefs rather than research. This is no longer mentioned in the article explicitly. 

As far as moving forward, I think the Gorsevski and the Flack sources are high quality and the reasons adduced for exclusion do not seem sufficient. I do not think we have to go into any detail on the contents of their critiques, but we should mention they exist and provide a citation. I also think that one major critique of NVC is that many organization have attempted to adopt it and found it problematic. This is the opinion of one of our high quality academic (and pro-NVC) sources. I think a sentence to this effect should be included, with the reference. I also think it would be legitimate to include here the opencouchsurfing.com and noesis.org mention, and Sarles self-published critique (which is discussed in the academic source). The pro-NVC academic sources are not afraid to address the critiques, so I am not sure why t",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Mdann52. We have added you to the list of clerks and subscribed you to the mailing list (info: WP:AC/C#clerks-l). Welcome, and I look forward to working with you! To adjust your subscription options for the mailing list, see the link at mail:clerks-l. The mailing list works in the usual way, and the address to which new mailing list threads can be sent is . Useful reading for new clerks is the procedures page, WP:AC/C/P, but you will learn all the basic components of clerking on-the-job.

New clerks begin as a trainee, are listed as such at WP:AC/C#Personnel, and will remain so until they have learned all the aspects of the job. When you've finished training, which usually takes a couple of/a few months, then we'll propose to the Committee that you be made a full clerk. As a clerk, you'll need to check your e-mail regularly, as the mailing list is where the clerks co-ordinate (on-wiki co-ordination page also exists but is not used nearly as much). If you've any questions at any point of your traineeship, simply post to the mailing list.

Lastly, it might be useful if you enter your timezone into WP:AC/C#Personnel (in the same format as the other members have), so that we can estimate when we will have clerks available each day; this is, of course, at your discretion. Again, welcome! Regards,  | Parlez Moi

I'm doing something over on WWE Championship and the champions' list to make a point.  If what you believe I am proposing here with Daniel Bryan is WP:Crystal, then the entire current WWE Championship scenario is also WP:Crystal, and we don't even have a verified idea as to who is WWE Champion is or what the valid lineage is at all.  For the same reason, is the """"vacation"""" and tournament similarly WP:Crystal, especially given some very real storyline questions which were never really addressed?  This is why you default back to what I stated when I quoted you Wikipedia's own """"not a crystal ball"""" situation.  Under your guise of WP:Crystal, not only do you reverse any mention of Miz/Mysterio, you must also reverse everything which was announced on the 7/18 RAW, including the title strippage!  But then is CM Punk even the champion at all, given several factors in the storyline going back to the """"worked shoot"""" promo?  If you want to open a WP:Crystal can of worms, then pro wrestling is a very bad place to be following announced events here on Wikipedia!

You Need To Change Your Username Or you Will Be be Blocked
[edit] Instructions
First, take a look at the username policy to make sure the username you are requesting is appropriate. Also, please note that for technical reasons, your username cannot begin with a lowercase letter, nor can it contain any underscores. 
Check to make sure the username you are requesting is not already taken. Do this by searching for the name in this list. If the name appears in the list, even if the link is red it is taken. Do not create an account under the new name. We'll do that for you. 
Log in with your present username in order to place your request. Renames will not be approved if the requestee is not logged in. 
Click here to place a request. 
Replace the text """"CURRENT"""" with your present username. 
Replace """"NEW"""" with the username to which you wish to be renamed. 
Fill in a reason where indicated but do not add anything in the """"subject/headline"""" box. 
If that doesn't work, simply copy the following text to your computer's 'clipboard': 
 CURRENT → NEW 

 Reason: Reason for requested renaming.   
Go to the """"Requests"""" section of this page, click the """"edit"""" link, and paste the text at the very bottom. Modify it as indicated above. 
Make sure that you have spelled both names correctly. Save the page. 
Check back periodically to answer any questions that may arise regarding your request. Do not be surprised if you suddenly cannot log in to your old account; this merely indicates that you should log in under your new name as the request has been fulfilled. 
Please be patient. It may take a few days for your request to be completed. 

Effects of a username change 
When the rename has been completed, your account will have been renamed, and any contributions you have made (including deleted contributions) will be reattributed to your new account as a background process. Your account preferences, watchlist contents, password, etc. will all be preserved, and your user and user talk pages will have been moved to the new name. 
Note: The process responsible for reallocating old contributions is currently dependent upon the job queue mechanism. As such, you may find old contributions do not immediately appear under your new account; this is perfectly normal. Updates should take at most a day to complete, although the length of time will vary according to the size of the job queue on this wiki, and the status of the server processes which process this queue. 
The change will appear in the user rename log and the request will be moved to the archives in the interest of transparency. It is not possible to rename accounts without an entry being created in the log. 
This change will not affect signatures you have already left on talk pages, or other places where you signed your username with   . Those pages will continue to display your signature (including the link to your old username) unless edited manually. 
Be aware: Once you have been renamed, your old account will no longer exist and may potentially be recreated by a third party. This is true even if your old account pages have been redirected towards your new account. To guard against impersonation, you may wish to recreate the old account yourself.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hey...... I did NOT attack other wikipedians. Get your facts straight. btw, certain things are more important. I really don't give a damn about your stupid """"rules"""".

And regarding attacking people, look through the archives in some of the 9/11 pages and you'll see """"moderators"""" behaving like little children by calling people names, and ignoring scientific facts and physical laws. You think censoring the truth about 9/11 is going to prevent the truth from coming out? Are you American? Then consider yourself a traitor to the country because that's exactly what you are.

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1,0,1,0,0,0

Hi ,
 Re 1 and 2: I don't have access to any additional facilities.  I am a run-of-the-mill editor like you, not an administrator.  Flagging suspected copyright violations is something any editor can do; it does not require administrator privileges.  The procedure for doing this is described on WP:CP.  It does take an administrator to delete a page, however, which is the usual result from suspected copyright violations.  The notice is posted on the article in question, and on the WP:CP page, nowhere else.  Again, I have no subscription to EB, nor any tools except search engines for detecting copyright violations.
 Re 3: If you scroll down WP:CP, you'll see it consists mainly of reports, with the occasional comment, many of which are not from the original poster.  Typically the original contributor does not respond at all within the seven day window.  There are many new contributors who happily copy-and-paste from other websites, with utter disregard of their copyright notices, and our policies.  Have a look at some of the listed items for examples.  Most entries on the WP:CP page are in dated sections under """"New listings"""", but some have """"fallen off the top"""" into """"Older than 7 days"""".  
 Re 4: If you look at the original report on WP:CP#July 11, you'll see that  listed that URL.  Presumably the same URL also appeared in the original copyright notice.  How that URL was found, I have no idea, but I would suspect search engines before spyware.  8-)  It's by a human comparison of that page with yours that I perceive a certain amount of similarity in phrasing and structure.  I'm prepared to accept that it's within the bounds of coincidence.
 Re 5: You are correct; permit me to clarify.  People often reproduce text from other websites citing permission with various constraints like """"in Wikipedia"""", """"for non-commercial purposes"""", """"providing it is quoted without alteration"""", or """"on condition that the source is credited in a particular way"""".  Unfortunately, none of those (except perhaps the last) is satisfactory for text in Wikipedia for the reasons I explained above.
 Re 6: New articles can be seen at Special:Newpages.  Changes to all articles can be seen at Special:Recentchanges.  Everyone has their own criteria for which entries they check, but most people are more suspicious of anonymous users than of logged in users.
 I note with regret that  has just blocked you for 24 hours.  In the same circumstances, were I an administrator, I would probably not have done this, but you have to admit that you did twist each other's tails quite a bit.  Perhaps this will give you a chance to concentrate on your other project.  8-) Note that you can still edit your user page, and I think you can still send e-mails using the """"E-mail this user"""" link.  I'll add a note to both entries on WP:CP that we are in a dialogue.
 This is probably an unnecessary remark, but I feel I should point out that if you edit Wikipedia from a different address and identify yourself to me, I will feel obliged to report it as block evasion.  This is independent of my feelings about the block itself.  Sorry.

 Sigüenza y Góngora 

Hi Rockero, thanks for all the work on the Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora article. Interesting material, and I'd never seen it before.

I have one minor question. Was his father really born in America? I knew Carlos was, but I had assumed his father was from Spain, because of the royal tutoring.

 
The oversight can perhaps be attributed to haste. My sources mention nothing abut his birthplace, but a Continental birth is much more likely, given the timeframe and his position. I changed it to peninsular, only to discover the deficiencies in that article.
I presume you are referring to S y G's theories about the origin of the Olmecs and the evangelization of Thomas when you say you found the new material interesting? Such theories were actually quite common, and it appears that SyG was one of the first to come up with them, or maybe just the first to popularize them. The Mormons were way behind. 8)
One final note: I'm guessing that """"book examiner"""" is your translation of """"corregidor general"""". Is this correct? My English-language sources make use of the term """"censor"""", which I can only guess is one and the same as corregidor general. I have added Censor (Catholic Church) to the censor dab page, in hopes of composing an article on the post, but refrained from linking it from the SyG article. If I am in error, please correct me. Thanks for your comments, and the pic looks great,  
Yes, if I remember correctly he was listed as corregidor general, but I'm away from my encylopedias now and can't definitely verify that. I'm sure I can find a copy of Enciclopedia de México in a library here (I'm in Los Angeles now), but it may be a little while before I get to that. """"Book examiner"""" wasn't really my translation. I had no idea what the original term meant, but I found him referred to as """"book examiner"""" on a web page, and I identified the two. I think it's safe to assume all three terms refer to the same office.

The scope of the project expands to more than just SCUMM games. Rewritten from C to C++ starting in 2002, addition of a GUI, etc. 
 Then the legal issues with LucasArts  this is far a more notable part of the history of the project than an alleged GPL violation many many years later  and their amicable resolution and ongoing development of the project. (That's just page 1)
 Then cooperation from games companies, sharing of source code and in some cases offering the games as freeware (a section of prose on this would provide context and make the long lists of later in the article more meaningful). ScummVM developers evening working with companies under NDAs. Merging the SCI engine goes from April fools joke to actual reality many years later. 
 page 4 of the article talks about the Mystic GPL issue that already has been given undue weight in this article, an issue best solved by rebalancing the article with more prose.

Quote """"We use the term ‘Grand Alliance’ or ‘Allies’ to describe an activated military alliance in WW1 that included Japan and Italy, and again use the term ‘Allies’ to describe on group in WW2 that does NOT include Japan and Italy. Not a big deal, except of course you can tell the ‘anti-Japanese’ wikipedia sites here because they do not mention Japan as a member of the ‘Allies’ despite it being and undisputed historical fact by English and Japanese historians. how I see it used in Asian history books""""

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Italy did change sides in WWII and a co-belligerent state supporting the allies established but the RSI was also set up a state in the North, however Japan was NEVER part of the allies in World War II! As for JAPANESE historians and history books – haven’t you heard about Japanese history textbook controversies .  

In WWI, Brazil declared war on Germany in 1917, however there was never any formal alliance signed between Brazil and the Entente, the Triple entente wasn’t even a formal alliance, but an agreement – there was a unity agreement, however that stated that they would not seek a separate peace with Germany. Britain only declared war on Germany after it invaded Belgium and the United States declared war on Germany and Austria Hungary in 1917 yet not on Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. They are called allies because they were ‘’united for a common purpose’’ - the defeat of Germany and or of the Central Powers as a whole, American industrial strength in terms of munitions and armaments also bolstered the British, French and other allies.   
In WWII, the ALLIES were overall fighting a common enemy at one point in time, and had a common purpose. SOME countries declared war yet did not send personnel to fight but assisted in the the allies in economic or other forms(severing relations etc.).       

Allies amd Axis
The Allies were those countries that joined together in an association against Germany then later Italy and Japan and those countries/movements associated with them(the Axis). In the beginning – Britain and it’s Commonwealth/Empire, France etc. and later countries that joined them against these powers including the US and Soviet Union and exiled governments. There were tensions between the powers especially Roosevelt - De Gaulle and Churchill/Roosevelt – Stalin, however there was mutual co-operation in the form of lend lease and other agreements. On January 1 1942 all of the belligerents signed a document called the Declaration by United Nations - the parties pledged to uphold the Atlantic Charter, to employ all their resources in the war against the Axis powers, and that none of the signatory nations would seek to negotiate a separate peace with Germany/Japan and the other member of the Axis.
Not all of the countries delcared war on all of the members of the Axis immediately or some not at all – eg.Brazil only declaring war on Japan on 6/61945. Some countries like only declared war on Japan because they entered to late in the war like Chile, other countries like the Norway and Poland declared war on Japan yet they did not contribute forces against Japan. 

A Global War
""""All I am saying is that if we want to portray that period of history accurately, that in the same way we do not include the Finnish Winter War nor the ongoing Chinese Civil War as part of what we call ww2, that we should record there being 2 separate wars: one in the ‘West’(Europe, Mediterranean) and one in the ‘East’(Pacific and East Asia), and therefore 2 separate groups of friends and foes, 2 separate formations of ‘Allies’. Then we also appear more moral historically.""""

""""What I am saying was that the war in Europe and the war in Asia were 2 separate wars. 2 separate groups of alliances. 2 separate military alliances we deliberately, or just simply irresponsibly, confuse by using the same title ‘Allies’ or ‘Grand Alliances’. Once we admit they were 2 separate wars, then it all makes more sense and make us look all the more moral.""""

""""So even today, we use the same title of an alliance to refer to 2 different wars at the very same time, in this case, right next to eachother even. But if you tell a Canadian, German or Hollander etc that they are members of the same ‘coalition’ at war in Iraq, they will take great offense at your ignorance.""""

Now that the communist threat is gone, it's no longer necessary to accommodate basic decency in dealing with employees, for example. I have worked on the bottom of the food chain long enough to know how many liberties some employers take with their employees. The irony is, of course, that out of fear of Communism, working conditions in the West were much better than in Communist countries. I still think the masses are cowardly, nasty, stupid, and disgusting in general. But, that's regardless of who they are made up of. Any assembly of people that exceed about a hundred people tends to take on disgusting behaviour. Just watch frat parties at 'elite' universities. Yuck. You don't even need 100 people for that. Humanity as such is vile, it's only redeeming feature is the occasional decent human being. My support for democracy is not based on any kind of sympathy with 'the masses', but it's simply based on the realization that there are no better alternatives. I am a Popperian democrat  democracy as a necessity, not moral imperative. The losing side of any revolution is always humanity (Menschlichkeit, not Menschheit; I trust you know enough German to get the difference). 

The famines inflicted on India, Ireland, and post-WWI Germany are just one of the few examples of how humans in general are simply disgusting. By the way, according to new findings in archeology, genocide was the method of choice in dealing with enemies for most of human history. Whether the 'noble savages', the carriers of 'white man's burden', the 'Ubermenschen', or the 'Avantgarde of the Proletariat', humans have not gotten better or worse throughout history, but have simply found new excuses for their native instincts.

You know, I've just been having this discussion on my talk page.  interesting.  What we currently have on project is a kind of pre-tribal band system, which can look like any other system (because the elements of all sophisticated political systems are present 'in the bud' in social bands). There are some elements of tribal society developing (Arbcom and administrators fill a role 'tribal elders' in loose tribal aggregates, policy and guidelines take on an almost mystical/devotional role in some discussions), but on individual pages it still largely devolves to conflicts between small ideologically insular groups fighting for control of a resource.  Aristocracy in any sense of the term would be a superior system; in Aristotle's sense it would be far superior.  

I'll admit that I'm a huge fan of consensus systems (I live for deliberative democracy…), but consensus systems are hard: they take a lot of self-reflection, a lot of self-moderation, and both a willingness and an ability to set aside small personal concerns in favor of large public concerns.  These features are noticeably absent from many of the more contentious discussions on project.  If we are not willing to take the steps to achieve a properly functioning consensus system, then we would really do better to try for another less-open approach, because dysfunctional consensus systems are ugly, ugly, ugly beasts.  It's why Aristotle considered 'democracy' the worst form of governance (because his understanding of democracy was more-or-less rule by the ignorant and emotionally volatile masses).

I can understand the argument that Timeshifter's second version contains too much detail for the lead.  But what was wrong with his first version?  I don't think the charge of original research holds; yes, there are contemporary news reports, technically primary sources, but policy doesn't forbid the use of primary sources, it just warns that it's easy to use them for original research.  In this case they aren't used that way.  There are plenty of secondary sources that cite those same events as the beginning of the second intifada; there's no OR.

The problem with Jay's version is that even though it acknowledges a dispute about which day the second intifada, it then weighs in on that dispute – thereby violating NPOV – by leaving out the events of the 28th and saying """"major clashes"""" didn't occur until the 29th.

To Aeusoes1 - Rewriting content, with no knowledge of the particular topic, and without looking at any sources, as you admit to doing, is the ANTITHESIS of what Wikipedia contributors should be doing. The majority of the article's content is careful paraphrasing of information from the sources. That is supplemented by quotations. Paraphrases are essentially careful re-wordings of quotes. When you, with no knowledge of the source texts, significantly change the paraphrases, you might as well be changing the direct quotes.

As for WP:BOLD, it states:
""""... but don't be reckless!""""
""""If you expect or see a disagreement with your version of the article, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, it's a good idea to list your objections one by one in the talk page, reasonably quoting the disputed phrases, explaining your reasoning and providing solid references."""" [italic added]
""""Then, wait for responses for at least a day: people edit Wikipedia in their spare time and may not respond immediately. If no one objects, proceed, but always move large deletions to the Talk page and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page."""" [italic added]
""""... avoid deleting information wherever possible"""" [italic added]
""""Be bold in contributions, but not in destructions. Editing is a collaborative effort, so editing boldly should not be confused with reverting boldly."""" [italic added]

You wrote: """"I really don't see how your knowledge of Hawaiian is relevant to my edits"""". Because I have near-native fluency in Hawaiian, as well as a PhD in Linguistics, I know that your uninformed attempts to rewrite the description of word stress, throwing out """"D"""" as a symbol for diphthong, are doomed to failure. For example, you made it have """"3. (C)VV"""" as a stress unit. If V expands as a diphthong, then """"wiuiu"""" can result - an impossible stress unit in Hawaiian. That's only ONE of MANY errors your edits cause.

More importantly, your rewrite is not supported by any sources. You failed to cite any references, and admitted that you don't care to look at any.

You wrote: """"My edits were all about format and not substance"""". That is false. See the preceding two paragraphs. Your rewrite of the word-stress content is substance, not format.

You wrote the phrase """"blindly revert"""" to describe my restoration of the original version. My revert of your edits is informed, not """"blind"""". I've seen an edit summary you wrote in the history of another phonology page where you made the same accusation against another user who undid your edits.

You point to the """"layout"""" of other phonology pages, calling it """"precedent"""". However, the Russian (RUS), Arabic (ARA), Romanian (ROM), Polish (POL), and Danish (DAN) phonology articles are not in compliance with Wikipedia guides. POL and DAN have no lead section. The leads of RUS, ARA, and ROM, violate WP:LEAD. None of those articles use boldface properly. ROM and POL have no references at all. RUS has only 2 old refs, ARA only 1 old ref. DAN has 8. None of those articles have even ONE CITATION to a reference. The """"layout"""" of those pages is not consistent.

In contrast, the Hawaiian phonology article (HAW), as originated by me, has a proper lead section, proper use of boldface, 8 references, and 70 citations to those references. HAW is one of the best-supported linguistics articles currently on Wikipedia.

I will undo your edits by restoring my last version of the article. Because you have persisted in """"forcing"""" your unsupported and objected-to edits into the article, I will ask a Wikipedia administrator to take a look at the situation. I will SUPPORT good changes, such as Jeioosh's idea about the stress-mark character. But I will OPPOSE bad changes, such as your uninformed edits.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

My very best wishes, I fail to see in what you posted above any logic,let alone valid reasons for including the statement. The current situation is hot now in a much more direct and immediate way than ever during the original Cold war: we have regular russian troops fighting right across Russia′s border, under an exceedingly thin cover of deniability, in Ukraine, part of whose territory has been formally annexed, which in turn is hosting the US intelligence and military advisors and personnel. But that is extraneous to the subject of discussion here. As i said above, I am not claiming that Putin′s words on 40 missiles are not """"important"""". I say that the exact meaning of those words, without a broader context and expertise info on the subject, is not clear (See my post above), and consequently the quote alone would stick out as a meaningless (or puzzling) throw-in. Then, you said above """"Russian nuclear weapons are actually in a workable state"""". May I ask you: Whose opinion is that? And what does it matter? The RF nuclear arsenal has NEVER been used in actual battle and thus its actual battleworthiness (which includes a wide gamut of capabilities, apart from just having warheads and delivery systems that can deliver unhindered in a situation where no one actually hinders) is a matter of assessment and supposition. That said, there is an overwhelming body of experts′ opinion that this arsenal IS formidable and capable of destroying the US both in a putative first strike and in a retaliatory strike, in a guaranteed way, even in a situation where the entire political and military leadership of Russia is destroyed (See Dead Hand (nuclear war)). I hear your point about """"this is all not about real capabilities, but about intentions and decisions that can be completely illogical"""". But where do you see any intentions, or illogical decisions in those words by Putin? He does appear to be boasting (by quite possibly lying as is common in such matters), but what is his intent? The most likely intent to be deduced from his words: he is trying to pull the wool over the eyes, and hide the rapid rate of the shrinking of the RF arsenal. But that is a speculation. If you can find an expert′s analysis of these words, then it may well be interesting and notable.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Unreliable sources misquotes source 

Your source for the extirpation by whalers of the Atlantic gray whales is suspect. Among the two sources it cites is Bryant's 1995 paper on Atlantic gray whale specimens. Bryant (p. 860, right column) merely speculates that whaling may have been the cause of its disappearance, stating that """"This population of gray whales apparently disappeared during periods of active coastal whaling on both sides of the North Atlantic, supporting the possibility [my italics] that whaling activities were responsible for, or at least contributed to, its extinction"""". However, these whaling activities (as far as we know) primarily targeted right whales, as I stated above. Earlier (p. 860, left column) he asks """"Could the eastern North Atlantic gray whale have been extirpated by whaling activities? Unfortunately, early whaling activities off the coast of Europe are poorly documented.""""

Now, if they cannot recombine and exchange their knowledge, they have to discover everything themselves. On the other hand, “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” Bernard Shaw explains the recombination principle: The human culture has advanced so rapidly just because you could spread the knowledge for free (I am not talking about climate in Wikipedia).

Lily Mazahery

Please identify the defamatory material you accuse me of posting.  Lily Mazahery was found by a DC Court of Appeals of misrepresenting human rights victims by taking money that was donated to the victims to assist them in their living expenses for her own personal benefit.  She was also found responsible for threatening them with deportation if they failed to assist in promoting her.  She was also found responsible for failing to adequately file their asylum claims.  All of those findings are sourced and can be found here: http://www.dcbar.org/download.cfml?filename=for_lawyers/ethics/discipline/pdf/hearing_committee/HCLilyMazahery21709etal.

What I did is modify her profile since the bits and pieces you left here conflict with one another.  For instance, it states """" Mazahery's practice primarily focuses on limmigration law and international human rights.""""  Thats untrue, she was suspended from practicing, so that can't remain in the active form.  It also states """"Mazahery is a strong advocate of women's rights and equal legal treatment of men and women in all cultures and societies.""""

 Gabriel Olutola 

There are some issues with Gabriel Olutola, which I just deleted.

I had previously identified some concerns with this article. You seem to understand that there were issues and agreed to address them. We let some time elapse so you could address them, but you did not make any substantive progress toward resolving the problems.

In addition, you are not communicating in a way that is desirable for editors. You are perfectly free to remove material from your talk page (although archiving is generally considered preferable). However, if you simply remove material and do not respond, it is difficult to understand your thinking. I don't know for example, whether you felt that you cured the copyright problems, or perhaps thought that the source of the text was an acceptable source. If you explain your actions it will be easier to help you.

I recently deleted the article because it had copyright problems and I saw no action by you to address them.

I don't know whether you thought it was deleted in error, whether you thought you cured the problem, or something else.

I notice that the version you restored is not exactly worded the same way as the source. However, we have seen editors who think that changing a word here or there cures a copyright problem. It does not. Please read the following link for more information: Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing

I also ran a duplication detector which does not pick up close paraphrasing, it only picks up exact matches. Even with this cruder measure the article is problematic. I'll provide the link below so you can see the results. However, I emphasize that changing a word or two here or there to eliminate the exact matches is not the cure.

I was writing in regards to the Cole Real Estate Investments page that you flagged for speedy deletion. I suppose I didn't see the tone as being overly promotional or advertising in nature.

4554be399eb32293,"While I am not the one to question your 'protecting' a page or article whether or not it is an FA category, I want to point out at least one inaccuracy in the Western Chalukya page.... I pointed out to user Dinesh Kannambadi about one portion of text mentioned in the article on the Western Chalukyas. The said portion is copied in here for your information and consideration as an admin:

The overall effort by Somesvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Somesvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time.[44] This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.[45]

In the above passage, while it may be ok for giving info on kingdoms in western deccan or deccan whose mutual antagonisms filled history annals.... I feel that mentioning the demise of the Cholas (who did so in 1279/1285 AD) in the Chalukya page who got eclipsed in 1190 WHICH IS ALMOST 90 YEARS PRIOR TO THAT OF THE CHALUKYAS, is quite inappropriate.

Mr.Kannambadi also mentions that the Chalukyas convincingly eclipsed the Cholas after the Cholas lost Vengi is quite untrue. This is because Vengi was lost by the Chalukyas to the Cholas themselves under Vikrama Chola for after winning Vengi in 1119 or 1118, Vikramaditya expired in 1125 or so and was followed by very weak successors and the Chalukya capital itself was lost for around 30 years from 1136-1140 (courtesy, Ancient India by K.A.N.Sastri, 1956 edition). So what does he mean there, by winning Vengi and keeping it for 6-8 years the Cholas were convincingly eclipsed by the Chalukyas... Does it mean that we are to believe that sustaining a victory for 6-8 years enables an empire to claim glory or feeling that their opponents were convincingly eclipsed.  I know Kannambadi will also speak about jingoism and that Hoysalas too won Gangavadi from Cholas, but pls. remind him that the same was prior to the Chalukyas conquering Vengi.  I am sure you will be very well acquainted with these facts in case you have in-depth knoweldge of Indian History especially that of South India.

I`ve had to wear a vest and have securities. I`ve had an S.W.A.T. team watch my family because of people who say they support you.

And I want to get your thoughts on this, and let`s set to rest some things when we come back. Shall we? 

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BECK: We`re back with Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, who is joining us tonight for a full hour. I want to make this very clear. I believe that Ron Paul, in general, the group of supporters, some of whom I`ve met while I was on the road, are amazing people. Without any help from the official campaign, Ron Paul supporters have coined the term """"The Ron Paul Revolution."""" They developed the concept for the Guy Fawkes Day money bomb back on November 5th which raised over $4 million. They hired a blimp to fly over New Hampshire to promote the Ron Paul campaign. Last Sunday, they held a tea party, where they broke John Kerry`s single day primary fundraising record by collecting another $6 million. But the downside is, when you have rabid supporters, some of them believe they can speak to their own agendas using the candidate`s name. And I just in the break showed Dr. Paul just a clip, a very small part of a five- minute video that is on the Internet where I am named a traitor and traitors should be executed. Can you  would you like to address that at all, sir?

It's called the cycle of abuse and neglect; You abuse other people and they neglect you, so to make youself feel all important; your now trying to make them pay attention to you by being even more nasty to them and others; and again - they and even more people want to have nothing to do with you.

There really are no bonus points to be had in being a bully who is nasty to everyone; but again you are responsible for making yourself into that kind of a person; so therefore it's a personal problem that is up to you to resolve by taking responsibility for the fact that you are choosing to be nasty to other people.

Indian martial arts
The dispute is that I've mentioned the official citations from Tsumi Hozan jujutsu, the Shaolin Temple, Gracie family and Goju Ryu Karate and what I keep getting is that Japan and China never interacted with any ancient civilization at all and the official citations don't mean anything, the facts when backed by the official citations will get an NPOV and Factual Inaccuracy tag and as if that was not enough I've been called anti- white people, pro tamil (I really have no idea when I came to be identified as a Tamil, I'm not anything even remotely close), Alex Doss (one of the guys believes that I actually am that guy) and biased, my credibilty now becoming a questionable thing, my sources are undisputed. 

I've cried myself hoarse for anyone to come dispute the official sources on the talk pages and no one comes forward to , they go mad because I mentioned a fighter from a game in the Indian martial arts in pop culture section and when they fraudeulently changed his fighting style from what CAPCOM officialy states, I objected.

I started the article, I've been sincerely working my ass off, the first few times I even edited the article so any legitimate grievances will be met.
Plus, I've constantly maintained that In addition to what I've officially cited here, I'll bring forward an assortment of websites confirming my facts and a huge list of academies and official citations from martial arts disciplines in near future but none of that stops the opposition from mindlessly putting the tags in there.

In other words, the information is undisputed, the official sources been mentioned and they confirm my stand, the opposition though, has adopted a technique of three-on-one encircling, deviation from the central topic of official citations (on which I have yet to hear why do they think that official citations are NPOV and Factually IC material) and mindless lies (like changing the fighting style of video game charecter Dhalsim) and have gone to the extent of telling me to """"be a nice chap"""" and more things to that effect. 

I've cited the official sources and that's it, if someone has a problem with the official versions they'll have to live with the fact that the problem  exists in their head and not in the article, the shaolin knows more about it's history than any of the three involved, it's a fact.

on the Creator
The demiurge is an expression of philosophy, in that it is a Greek or Hellenistic cultural concept. This means that the Demiurge is a cultural concept from the Greeks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingness as non-substantive (ex-nihilo). They treated nothingness as a substance called aether. The Greeks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from """"something"""". Plato it was the good, Aristotle it was energy, Plotinus it was force. These are ontological noema that create consciousness in humans. This arises from the unique essence of Greek or Hellenistic philsophy treating the natural (physic) and supernatural (metaphysic) as extensions of human consciousness. So everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousness and therefore must be expressed from a anthropomorphic perspective. God or Gods can not be anything outside of human. That's why Zeus and the Gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them. The demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates. The Greek Orthodox Christian God is not relatiable to the Actus et potentia as the Roman Catholic God since, God in essence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make God's being, essence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the Ortohodox Christian God. The Christian God is not one (the monad) or unity according to St Dionysus the Areopagite.   
Orthodox Christianity did not have the same God therefore the """"concept of God"""" uses and has familiar language (between Hellenstic Greek and Byzantine Greek) but in essence, substance is a different concept of God. In Greek Orthodox Christianity (which Iamblichus kinda tried to graft into Neoplatonism after the fact) God is in and outside the Universe. God is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since God's consciousness ontologically is hyper-being. Meaning that God as a substance can not be detected nor contained. Now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis, immanence or existence (cataphatic). The Pagan philosophical God was a detectable substance that all things derive from and reduced to. The Orthodox Christian God is a hyper substance that is not empirically detectable. Mankind has to be altered in order to detect it. Since the God in Greek Orthodox Christianity in his trinitarian completeness (uncreatedness) does not have the same consciousness as mankind, did not share mankinds consciousness until he became a human being AKA Jesus Christ. The reverse is only true in Philosophy since in Orthodox Christianity God as a whole has a consciousness which is completely unrelatable to mankind. Philosophy God and mankind have the same consciousness and Roman Catholicism and Protestantism treat God ontologically very much as modalistic (like Sabellianism) which creates also a different consciousness. Orthodox Christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic-izing the Christian God, which can only come from not actually having experiencing the Christian God (theoria) and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic God of philosophy.

 stradbroke galleon / portuguese 

hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by """"mainstream"""" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the """"mainstream"""" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Edits for Your Consideration

Well I see the hounds are already out rapidly editing, which is fine.  Two requests for your consideration please:
1) """"Texas Government Newsletter"""" needs a reference.  It had one but it was removed so it is now un-referenced.  The reference I have below is from the Library of Congress US Copyright Office showing the official copyright by me of the publication.  Seems like a really SOLID ref to me.   Here it is (although I cannot test my coding so please verify it is right, although the link is definitely correct. I used their exact additional language re the copyright):

Texas Government Newsletter / Don Martin (i.e. Donald G. Martin) editor.  ISSN: 0164-9221. U.S. Government Copyright Office.

2)  NN has removed my client list as expected.  The fact that I have such top-notch clients (Dell, Tokyo Electron, AT&T;, Southland Corp, etc) seems to me to help establish at least some level of notability and shows the level where my business operates. All of the listed clients (100%) have Wikipedia pages and are therefore all also internal links.   To be fair, he, on the other hand, asserts that the article is about the man, not the business, and the external link to my website should cover it.  I guess it is a decision for other editors to make.   Please consider if this edit might should be reverted.   Thanks.  (Don Martin)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 And just for the record, I (unsurprisingly) sincerely belief that not much new technology will come out of Newman's invention. Even leaving all the contradictions to physics aside, there is a much more pragmatic argument: Any electric motor design which """"only"""" cut backs losses by 50% (going from 90% to 95% efficency) would be of outmost commercial importance. You would be able to go (with bodyguards and lawyers if you prefer) into the development centers of Siemens, EMD, or Bombardier, demonstrate your working prototype and leave as a very rich man.
   
RI^2 = heat losses
RI*(meters/ohm) = current times distance = current momentum
Current momentum can be determined by integrating current along the length of wire (with dl as the derivative length).  It can be found in the Biot-Savart law.
To maximize current momentum / heat losses, the following should be maximized:
RI*(meters/ohm) / RI^2 = (meters/ohm)/I = cross-sectional area of wire / (resistivity * current)
But current momentum produces the magnetic field, the square of which is proportional to its energy.  So to maximize the energy of the magnetic field / heat loss.
R^2*I^2*(meters/ohm)^2 / RI^2 = R*(meters/ohm)^2 = distance^2/ohm
Just use a longer wire! I guess the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy, causing electromagnetic radiation. Even the simple movement of a charge can cause a magnetic field, causing acceleration, and therefore radiation! If the wire is so short, that is like shorting the battery (e.g. connecting them in series) and not using the charges to your advantage.  

OK, so I'd like to start by saying that I may more or less completely misunderstand you, but (apart from a very good remark about the mass to energy conversion), your statements look rather heterodox to me. Granted, Newman would have to have found new physics to make his machine work, but I assume we are discussing textbook physics and EE in this side note. Specifically:
 It's not the resistive (heat) losses (or other losses) which bound the electric motor's efficency to 100%. Even using a supraconducting coil and everything you wish, you won't get above 100%  the counter voltage induced by the rotation will make the input power needed to sustain rotation equal to mechanical work done.
 Equal amount of copper will give you motors of equal parameters, only with voltages and currents scaled in different, compensating directions. E.g. both thse setups will give the same magnetic field and motor operation:
 1 meter of 0,15 mm diameter copper wire (about 1 Ω) at 4 V and 4 A (stall current) and
 4 meter of 0,075mm diameter copper wire (about 16 Ω) at 16 V and 1 A (stall current)
 But I agree with your guess that the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy. Every time some energy is transported away from a system, the system loses mass according to E=mc²  in most cases an unmeasurable low amount. Also if you temporarily attach strings to the oppositely charged bodies, you can extract mechanical energy while reducing their distance, exactly that amount of mass will be lost (If we keep the system isolated, its total mass stays the same, e.g when letting the two bodys clonking together, the energy will first be converted to kinectic energy, then to heat, and both contribute to the mass of the system, which in effect stays constant). But in a motor the movement is periodic, so there is nothing in sight which can result in mass loss  unless some copper atoms are vanishing mysteriously or sort of transmutate into something other than normal copper.

 Comment 

My comments on Malleus' talk page were well beyond civil, even for a user talk page. They were a personal attack, and warranted serious sanction. 

For the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that's not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to """"bait"""" or """"poke"""" him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously. 

I lost respect for Malleus when he said, """"You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you're trying to repeat the trick."""" I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That's where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.

But my rant wasn't aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that's been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project. 

It's a feeling, so I'm not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It's to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I'm pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what's required is difficult. I agree. That's the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.

With regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it's the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it's their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I'm glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you're going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.

I'm disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that """"we don't care if we offend our readers."""" Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don't want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.

And finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It's there now; Google her name and """"sex tape"""" and you got it. She's now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.

The tape's existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the """"nudge, nudge, lucky bastard"""" type of comment, but it doesn't seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked """"Should we mention the tape?"""" Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it's borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won't elaborate further; you either get it or you don't.

And it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it's borderline notable and the subject doesn't want it. 

Although Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject's claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I'd add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.

when the current flag was designed in the early 1990s, were the people who made the flag aware of these supposed medieval connections? Or were they simply pointed out later by vexillologists? What is the earliest reference to the post-1991 flag?  Adoption by the  United National Movement dates to c. 1999.  Kldiashvili wrote a """"History of the Georgian heraldry"""" in 1997.

Hi, thanks for the comment... The thing about that bit you added was it actually refers to the original/real meaning of taint as defined at wikt:Taint#Etymology 2, so it's not really relevant for this article. And no, I couldn't find and sources either!

And yeah, I put forward the article for AfD and have worked on it since there was no conclusive result - make the best of a bad situation ;)

Hi, nice to meet you. I'm mostly into classical music, but I'll take a peek at Smashed Gladys on your account. I would suggest waiting until you've been here at least three months or so, usually people are hesitant to grant adminship to someone who hasn't been here that long. When I said that  I loved awards and food, I meant WikiFood...like the cookies you see on my page. ;) I don't really have a problem with my weight. ;) Ciao! Girl♪ 
I would definately second what  said below. I'm not saying you're a bad user, I've just not seen much of your work around. Who are you working with?  is not a registered user as of yet. I did look at your article you mentioned. If I remember correctly, it looked good, but as I said, I have no interest in rock/pop/jazz/etc., so didn't pay much attention. Joshua Bell, Itzhak Perlman, Julia Fischer, Midori Goto, and Sarah Chang are all young classical musicians, if you want a partial list of some. Ciao!Girl♪

Hi Pickelbarrel. Well, I'm a Wikipedia:Administrator, which means that, apart from the usual work of editing and writing articles I can do a few additional things associated with trying to keep the place running smoothly and cleaning up when it runs less smoothly. So I can (un)delete articles, (un)block account, (un)protect pages and edit protected pages within strict limits. That's all, though. Some people find these things useful, others are fine with never having those additional abilities and the responsibilities that come with them.

The actual process to becoming an admin is to make a Request for Adminship, in which the community will scrutinise your general conduct and work. Generally, the community does not grant adminship to users with less than 3 months of good contribution across a reasonably broad spectrum of activity. After all, if you're going to have the ability to help look after the place, you need to be well-familiar with how it normally looks and works. So you need to show that your responsible and trustworthy, civil when in conflict and that you have a good grasp of the various policies, guidelines and common practises. There's a lot of advice in WP:GRFA which you can look through. You can also read through the current nominations on WP:RFA and see the reasons people give for supporting and opposing requests.

You may find that your time on Wikipedia is entirely fulfilling without the additional admin tools — after all, you don't need any of them to actually write the encyclopedia. -talk

In other words, all the terms considered from Gaulish origin could come from non-IE as it could not be connected to any Celtic or Latin words and other IE families languages. 

The continental celtic terms are probably very similar to the Latin and Italic ones. The function words are mostly more reliable to determine what is from Gaulish origin or not, see 'Discussion' in Gaulish (language); the similarities with contemporary French words are in some cases astonishing and closer to Latin or what were Italic languages. In my opinion, there is not doubt that Italic and Celtic languages (especially Continental celtic) were once in the same group that formed the Italo-celtic family languages as the Balto-slavic group and probably the Germanic languages are from the same branch.",0,0,0,0,0,0

When Muhammad Ali didn't want to fight against Vietnam, his pacifism wasn't Islamist.  Sure, a true Muslim would not have supported or joined in the American war on Vietnam, but that is not called Islamism.

 GISIN page edits 

Thanks for your attention to the GISIN wiki page.  However, RE: your removal of """"note that this should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""": this was added because (at least one of) the GISIN participants were worried that folks might begin attempting to use the (draft) GISIN protocol for development.  In fact, they asked me (yes, I know, it's a wiki, they could have done it themselves...) to change the wording on the page to make SURE no one began investing time in what is now a moving target.  Is it really that bad to have this clarification there?  (""""Draft"""" may mean different things to different people.)  If it makes you feel any better (which I'm guessing it won't, because I know you have a particular reason for your edit), that part won't stay there forever; eventually, the protocol will be released as a """"live"""" (perhaps versioned) product, so this disclaimer will be unnecessary.  However, at this point, I fear that the person who asked me to make the change (who is basically the technical lead on the GISIN project) will become (perhaps justifiably) annoyed if this point is not made clear to his satisfaction.  (He actually requested that the GISIN Wikipedia entry be DELETED if this weren't made clear.)

So... any way you could see fit to re-include that text (or something similar that would serve the same purpose)?

(P.S. - As I think about it, in truth, the onus should really be on the maintainer of the linked sites to ensure that anyone that got to that URL would knowin terms that the site author wants folks to knowthat it """"should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""".... hmmm... I think I'll pass this along to the concerned party....)

 Moving Teras Kasi from """"Movies and Television"""" to """"Games"""" 

 
Though the game Masters of Teräs Käsi is set in the Star Wars universe, the fighting style exists only in video games, namely Masters as well as Star Wars: Galaxies. It has never been mentioned in the movies, and is not part of the canon. I propose that this entry be moved to the games section.

Teras Kasi is also part of several Star Wars novels written by Steve Perry. So it is not just used in games, it is is also used in several of Steve Parry's star wars novels.

JJL, 23 November 2005
Tai Shing Pek Kwar is a real style of monkey kung fu, not (or in addition to?) a fictional one. It's the style of Paulie Zink. Does it belong here?

On Taejutsu, it was not invented by Seth McFarlane for """"Family Guy"""", although he might have thought so at the time. Taejutsu is actually the name of the unarmed fighting style which is part of Ninjutsu. See any book by Stephen K. Hayes.

Thats Taijutsu, different spelling. Also I second the moving the Teras Kasi thing, never been in or near the movies, and I don't believe that it does have any relation or connection to the the Force, the article on it certainly says nothing about that. Lastly is Fuck You not infact a joke Mike Myers said in So I Married An Axe Murderer, not a fictional martial art from that movie?  

 Miss Ho style 

While drunken boxing is real, the drunken Miss Ho style Wong Fei Hong makes up is not.

Miss Ho is one of the eight drunken immortals of legend, and her movements are part of the Eight Immortals Style, as well as other forms of Drunken Boxing.

Also, wouldn't lightsaber fighting be broken up into the dark side and the light side?
 In fact, it is mentioned in canon resources that there are seven traditional lightsaber fighting styles (or, they are mentioned up through seven), though their exploration is done entirely in non-canon. 

 Naruto 

What about adding the martial arts from Naruto? Tekken Taijutsu (with its swirling leaf attacks and inner gate openings), Jyuken Taijutsu with its Dim Mak-ness, etc.

 CQC 

I've seen references and articles that state that CQC is a real combat system and the MSG3 CQC style is simply a version with a alternative history and modified for gameplay. Not really a fictional MA. Someone should check this out. 

I believe CQC is real only because I saw it on many websites describing it's origin (all are the same), The history channel, and...wikipedia >_> I'll just go ahead and remove CQC from the list. 

""""CQC"""" is an acronym for """"Close Quarters Combat"""". It's just a generic term for armed and unarmed close combat tactics, not a specific art, although there are several military and paramilitary organizations that use it to refer to their hand-to-hand training systems. On the other hand, the thing featured in MGS3 is a specific fictional art, albeit inspired by real-life tactics...

 Wrestlecrap 

Just wanted to give you a heads up. The edit you made to Wrestlecrap that you stated was """"reverting vandalism"""" was actually putting vandalism back onto the page. I would've assumed you were vandalizing the page yourself until I noticed your other contributions and saw that you revert a lot of vandalism elsewhere. That's when I realized it was probably a misunderstanding so I decided to message you and let you know. A few of us have been having a really hard time with several vandals who keep re-registering after getting banned, so if you could keep a lookout it would be a big help to us. Thanks  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

e7d3543815292a53,"""::::::: Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
 I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid?Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 

The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page. 
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.
God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

 Chronology of first translation (by nation) in national newspapers 

I have added to sections (which might be suitable as subsections of a yet to be determined section), 
""""Date of the first translation (by nation) in national newspapers""""
""""Translations published on websites of national newspapers""""

The sections are notable and encyclopedic. (When was the last time a poem was translated and printed in national newspapers in more than 4 countries?)

That websites print poems, is possibly less notable then when national newspapers in different countries prints them. (There seems to be somewhat of a threshold regarding printing poems in newspapers, on pages allocated to literature reviews etc—the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten is one example of a newspaper that did not print the poem on a page assigned to literary review.)

As the first section is improved, then it might indicate the chronology of when the very first national newspapers (in various nations) printed translations of the poem.

 Move this page to """"Signed zero""""? 

If I read this article and think """"What would be a proper title?"""" """"Signed zero"""" seems to be the only answer I can come up with. In fact """"−0"""" is indeed a strange name for it, and """"−0 (number)"""" is even stranger..

This is also the phrase they use in IEEE P754 pdf.

Doing this, the article could expand, describing the algebra of signed zero (with signed infinity?), giving the subject a more formal treatment and mathematical rigor.

This exotic mathematical area is interesting, in particular because it is applied in computer science, and it deserves a good name!

For now, """"Signed zero"""" redirects here, of course we would reverse that and not deleting """"−0 (number)"""".

Sad that some editors jumped to conclusions without reading or analyzing the article or using the proper AfD process, but I recognize that there is a lot of emotion these days. It took over an hour to build the article but seconds were spent to kill it.

First I carefully reviewed (again) the BLP policies so I could carefully follow them. Than I used the Article Creation Template (or whatever its called) with it's step by step questions. The result of those questions was to create the article. I also check that there are no conflicting articles.  The less than ideal article name is because there is a completely unrelated http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha (an Russian Olympic mascot, not a person). When a last name is known, obviously the article would be renamed.

Next I did not just paste in some news report. I stitched together various reports in a logical topical arrangement using unique language plus direct quotes from involved people. 

I created it from a variety of sources (over 7 different ones anyway) and ref'd the heck out every statement per BPL which says """"We must get the article right. Be very firm about the use of high-quality sources. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be explicitly attributed to a reliable, published source, which is usually done with an inline citation. Contentious material about living persons (or in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced – whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable – should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion."""". Before saying this is a BLP violation please show which statements were not reliably sourced to published sources with inline citations.

I did ref the Daily Mail (admit not the very best source at times) sometimes because they were pulling info from various places and some of it was a little different than other sources so I wanted to reflect both versions where info seemed to conflict. However, the most comprehensive source I've found so far is an AP article. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bomb-suspect-influenced-mysterious-radical There are more than 1.1 million hits on Google for """"Boston Marathon Misha"""" as I write so an argument that this person is not WELLKNOWN is debatable. 

The article is not strictly negative. It states reported bio info (granted there is limited info to report). Mostly it summarizes a real debate through the media between various family members (mainly the Maryland uncle and a former husband of a sister) who cite Misha as the driving force behind Tam's radicalization and the mother who says he was just a nice guy. The various interviews are easy to find and widely quoted, though I believe the refs were mostly to the original media sources or multiple sources.  

There is some wild speculation about this guy by the media out there. I specifically excluded any of that from the article. My goal was to write an over referenced, comprehensive, neutral, informative article that accurately pulls together the various media reports so far.  Like many articles, there is room for improvement. The article was redirected (as a sub for a deletion nomination) before anyone even had a chance to properly review it and improve it. 

BLPCRIME may not apply as no one, and certianly not the article, is accusing Misha of a crime.

The absence of a known complete name does not disqualify a person from having a Wikipedia article. Consider DB Copper and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name 
Anyway, considering how many people are searching this guy I expect he will be found and a page will get created or restored.  Cheers,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Alternative Judaism
Zain, I think that Alternative Judaism is a good place to put the disclaimer about other religious groups that claim they are Jews, but I do think it is worth looking at the links a bit further, since I think you might have misread some of them. Also, remember that there is a difference between claiming descent from the """"Israelites"""" and actually claiming to be practicing Judaism.  Here are the links you keep using to illustrate your points, and that you added to the article:

 Anglo-Israelism  Never claimed to be Jews, they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites.  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism. I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way.  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article.
 Christian Identity  Weird choice.  They hate Jews, look at the text of the article, where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil. Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism, nor are they Jews.
 Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity, or possibly Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article.
 Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article
 Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited
 Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians, not a current group.  This is like including Jews Harp in the list - it is a reference to a historical label, not a religion.
 Jews for Jesus  Already in the article that you edited
 Messianic Renewed Judaism  A minor subset of Messianic Judaism
 Lost Ten Tribes  Not a religion, but another good place to put these sort of links
 British-Israel-World Federation  See Anglo-Israelism

Yes the work was influential.

Priestley also designed visual study aides for his Lectures on History: A Chart of Biography (1765)[26] and A New Chart of History (1769).[27] According to Priestley, they """"impressed"""" upon students """"a just image of the rise, progress, extent, duration, and contemporary state of all the considerable empires that have ever existed in the world"""".[28] Both charts had accompanying prose descriptions and were popular for decades—A New Chart of History had gone through fifteen editions by 1816.[29] The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the University of Edinburgh to grant him a Doctor of Law degree in 1764.[30]

The """"neutrality"""" tag and """"original research"""" tag was put up by THF, who works for a right wing lobbyist; Cool Hand Luke wishes to keep them in because he appears to be following up old grudges, as can be seen from the conflict of interest entry for THF above. He has, ironically, deleted a good reference to US law, and does not seem to actually be concerned about approving the article.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dbiel/ScratchPad/NCCC_accomplishments for numerous reliable external sources of information about NCCC that could be incorporated into this article.

I regret that detailed explanations are too much for you and try your patience.  That's your issue.  If you really want to edit complex material, get used to it, or get out.

What I take """"personally"""" is anyone - and in this case that means you  who uses scurrilous and unethical practices to demean something like NCCC that has been of great value to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Americans and will be badly needed in the future.

You should hang your head in shame and back out of this process.  Find something to do where you cannot injure something of value.

Those who reflexively defend your efforts out of misguided sympathy are not doing a whole lot better.  I want no part of any editorial """"team"""" that includes you, unless you are confined to an advisory role.

Unlike you, I am making statements here based on facts, not resorting to ugly name-calling as you so often have.  (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:National_Civilian_Community_Corps/Archive_1)

Any editor who wants to write down and communicate specific edits that make content better suited for Wikipedia, rather than simply delete that content, has my regard.  So far, I have seen almost none of that from anyone  just vague references to one Wikipedia tenet or another followed by an ultimatum that content will be deleted, which occurs in spite of a good-faith response.

(The point about St. Martin's Press, which you profess not to understand, below, is that you abused their good reputation by using it while falsely stating that St. Martin's Press published a book with an entire chapter of criticism of NCCC.

I have added the necessary qualification.  Regarding the original lead, it was a mess. Amongst other things the original lead had redundancies, it employed terms without first defining them or linking to a definition, sometimes the term """"compound"""" was used and other times """"statment"""" was used, the relatively minor matter of material implication vs. logical entailment was too long, used an awful example and just confused what preceded it.  In the lead it would have been sufficient to just say something like: """"The material conditional is to be distinguished from logical entailment (which is usually symbolosed using [double turnstile].""""  The distinction can then be detailed in the body of the article.  Also the failure to even mention propositional calculus  which is the context in which someone is most likely to look up the meaning of the operator  was an unacceptable omission.  By the time someone reaches the study of paraconsistent logical systems they will likely have no need to look up what a material conditional is on Wikipedia.  A novice is most likely to look up this entry in wikipedia and they will most likely have encountered the operator in the context of classical/Boolean propositional calculus.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

While I am somewhat dissapointed by D'Adamo's lack of footnotes, and frustrated by his avoidance of indexes, I haven't yet found a credible direct dispute to any significant claims of his. I am aware of a text that might indicate behavior of lectins on stomach tissuus would need to be directly studied, but I wasn't willing to spend in excess of $200 US (iirc) to find out what exactly it found, depite it being a """"real"""" scientificly strict (apparently, as I didn't actually get to read the) study. 
While not as rigourously strict with the science as it should be (at least what is presented in his books) ER4YT doesn't seem to be significantly paranormal or disprovable. So while it has a stigma of pseudoscience, that stigma hasn't really been justified.  Some supposed refutation I have come across turned out to be of even poorer quality, either reflecting it's own pseudoscience, or a lack of familiarity with the nominal subject. I would really like to see some explicit, maybe even rigorous debunking of D'Adamo's (occasionaly controversial? I can't see why) offerings. As of yet, I consider this closer to protoscience than unfalsifiable pseudoscience. 
In any case, I don't think that anything I previously posted on this matter is all that fantastic.  Is the mere mention of Doctor D'Adamo, or Eat Right For Your Type (ER4YT) enough to invalidate the respose I offered?  Other than that vague stigma, is my above answer to the utility of divergent blood types unhelpful or incorrect? I do believe that I was careful enough to avoid anything that wasn't NPOV.

This discussion was started on your talk page, please reply on your talk page and not elsewhere, this is common decency as others might be following the debate there and not where ever - thus I will be copying your reply to me and this reply to your own talk page.
Now to the questions you raise;
I have no need to complain to who ever placed the 'award' on your page as I'm not concerned with their action but your own, if the 'award' had not been present I would still have raised your edit style on you talk page, doing so is a way of informally pointing out to you (and others) that you might need to look at your action, rather than making any complaint official.
Now for the reason (in my opinion) you cause the decent you do: It's because of your style, not why you edit (or indeed what you edit), you think you are right and everyone else is wrong, even when the consensus or the facts shows otherwise - you might not like the """"cozy consensus"""", as you put it, but in a democracy that is how it works, if you don't like that simple fact of life Wikipedia is probably not for you. Buy yourself some web space, learn some HTML/PHP, then you can publish """"The facts according to Lucy-marie"""" to your harts content... ( )

""""Does it really matter where a debate takes place?""""

Ernie: Well, I'm not surprised at all.  Of course I'll support the templates. They provide a super purpose in linking films.  To be honmest, that's one of the reasons I started editing Argentine films.  I saw the cohesiveness of the section.  The template is very important.

The problem is ego and the """"psychology"""" of some wikipedians.  Some may feel they should have control in the section they work in.  People begin to take """"quasi"""" proprietary thoughts about not only their area of expertise on wiki, but in the edits they make in that area.

There are others who may take the same approach to other areas of the cinema world but place ego very much into it (I've never found you that way).  They subconsciously took it as an affront that you did not talk to them first.   That's why I'm hesitant to take on other areas in the world of cinema, there are so many footprints and egos to deal with.

I agree with Hoverfish completely as to the approach you take vis a-vis the arguments you make in this matter.  I also state that I'm in """"touch with your emotions.""""

Romanization for words of English origin
On the MOS:JP talk page, a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of English origin, such as Fainaru Fantajī in  (for the sake of simplicity, I called this case """"words of English origin"""", more information on semantics here).

Over the course of a month, it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side. Therefore, a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties. One suggestion on a compromise has been given already, but it has not found unanimous agreement, so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested.

One universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus, and you were one of those selected in the process.

What this invitation is:
 You should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions.
What this invitation is not:
 This is not a vote on including or excluding such romanizations.
 This is not a vote on compromises either.

It would be highly appreciated if you came over to the MOS:JP talk page and helped find a solution. Thank you in advance.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Alleged I-605
Back in 2000, here's what was reported about the possibility of an I-605 being built:
""""Another WSDOT released study in 2000 suggested an I-605 beltway that stretched roughly from Tacoma through the Snoqualmie Valley and then to Everett would pull an estimated 29,000 cars off of Interstate 5. But the state never acted on the idea, instead focusing on other ways to relieve congestion on I-5.  The idea drew such opposition that the King County Council eventually amended the county's comprehensive plan to specifically forbid such a roadway from cutting through the area."""" From: http://www.king5.com/topstories/stories/NW_071504WABi605JK.2ffde016b.html.  In other words, the possibility of I-605 ever being planned, let alone built, died about 8 years ago.

The name is, to be blunt, nonsensical. No actual 10-string guitarist or authority on this instrument uses this terminology, which is entirely 's own creation. Why the anachronistic """"classical""""? Neither the 10-stringed harp-guitar of the 19th century nor the modern 10-string guitar is an instrument from the Classical period, and an acoustic guitar is as little limited to the performance of so-called """"Classical"""" music as an acoustic piano is. And what exactly is meant by """"extended-range""""? Extended from what? This is assuming that the guitar had a fixed range, which is a fallacy considering most of the notable guitarists of the 19th century (Sor, Carulli, Coste, Mertz, Legnani, Manjon, etc.) also wrote for/performed on guitars with more than 6 strings, many of which had a treble range that was extended beyond the 19th/20th fret that is the norm on today's guitars. All in all this is a nonsensical title for an article that should simply be called """"ten-string guitar"""" that that should include only historically significant instruments (i.e. not things like the Marlow 10-string guitar). And there should be a separate article for the """"Yepes 10-string guitar"""", which this article currently simply continues to confuse with unrelated developements that have nothing to do with the primary defining characteristic of the Yepes instrument: its singualr tuning which uniquely gives sympathetic string resonance in unison with any note fretted on the treble strings.

 A philosophical story to embrace ones mind. 

The ancient Indian mathematicians were the first to discover the digit zero """"0"""" and implement it in the formation of digits. The whole world revolves like a cycle in the form of the digit zero. The Britishers dicovered an ancient egg of Dinosaures in India. What I mean to convey is that: India is the land where Lord Rama or Lord Krishna were born. Lord Rama was an example of a perfect ideal man on earth. His life story is an example for an ideal man to follow. Lord Rama, Lord Lakshmana, Lord Bharata and Lord Shatrughana were four sons of King Dhasratha of Ayodhya. He was cursed to die from the pain of separation from his son by the blind parents of Shrawan Kumar. Kaikeyi the mother of Bharata wishes to send Lord Rama on an exile for a period of 14 years and wishes her son Bharata to be the King of Ayodhya. Lord Rama and his wife Sita and his brother Lord Lakshmana leave for forests outside the kingdom of Ayodhya. Lord Rama's brother Lord Bharata persuades lord Rama to return back but lord Rama refuses to return to Ayodhya against the wishes of his step mother Kaikeyi. But Lord Bharata returns to Ayodhya along with the sandals of lord Rama and places the sandals of his brother Lord Rama on the throne and rules the kingdom of Ayodhaya in the name of Rama. This shows the example of love between an elder brother and his younger brother. In the forest once a demon shurpanaka sister of King Ravana disuades Lord Rama to marry her, but Lord Rama tells her that he is already married and points towards his brother Lord Lakshmana who cuts off her nose and ears to show her ugly nature and character. Shurphanaka runs off and complains about Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana to King Ravana of Lanka. King Ravana somehow manages to kidnap Goddess Sita the wife of Lord Rama in revenge to Lanka. Lord Rama grieves for his separation from his beloved wife Goddess Sita. Here the feelings of an ideal person in the form of lord grieving from separation from his beloved wife are beautifully described by Sage Valmiki who wrote the whole Ramayana. Sage Valmiki was a thief named Ratnakar who by the japam of Lord Sri Rama became a great sage named Valmiki and wrote a great epic called Ramanaya the story of King Rama and Sita. Lord Rama and Lord Lakshamana move towards southern India where they meet the lord Hanuman, (the great son of Anjani and Kesari; Lord Hanumanji is also known as Pavanputra or the great celibate bachelor) and Lord Sugriva and with the help of vanara sena or Army of Monkeys they move into the kingdom of Lanka and kill the demon king Ravana. Lord Rama rescues Goddesses Sita and with the help of Lord Hanuman they return back to Ayodhya. A fourteen years had lapsed when lord Rama had left the kingdom of Ayodhya. When lord Rama, Goddesses Sita, Lord Lakshmana and lord Hanuman return to Ayodhya, the people of Ayodhya cheer up and lit up the whole Ayodhya with Diyas in order to celebrate the victory and return of their king Lord Rama. The festival Dusherra is celebrated every year as a victory of good over evil as the demon Meghanad {the son of King Ravana},the demon Kumbhakarna {the brother of king Ravana} and the demon King Ravana of Lanka were killed by Lord Rama and Lord Lakshmana in order to rescue Goddesses Sita from her captivity in Lanka. And on the occassion of their return to Ayodhya the festival Diwali is celebrated throughout India every year with  great pomp and show of lights and crackers. Whenever some troubled minds read this story of Ramayana their minds gain peace and the self confidence is restored as their spirits become calm, pacified and brave in the troubled periods of time. The Epic Ramayana denotes the greatness of Supreme God Lord Rama as an ideal human being on earth.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Not Good for Straight Forward Understanding of Advances 

Without clear categorization of advances tracked through time, how can one get any meaning out of the article?

For example, tracking the maximum number of quantum bits in a single entanglement according to date would be much more meaningful than the current listing of ad hoc, haphazard, and arbitrary """"achievements"""". 

Also comparing the number of quantum bits needed for various types of tasks such as breaking encryption would be very informative in comparison to current accomplishments, because it would expose how little progress we have really made.

A great example of this would be to show how many quantum bits the D-Wave machines achieve in individual entanglements.  This would expose the misguided impressions generated when D-Wave talks about the number of quantum bits on a single board as that has almost nothing to do with the number of quantum bits achieved in a individual entanglements. 50.0.36.35  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Moline 2 

A few days ago I asked you why you reverted my efforts on the Moline, Illinois page and either I didn't get a response from you or I didn't receive it.  In your initial message to me, given at the time when you reverted all of the work I had done, you called my efforts vandalism and nonsense; I realize this is probably a auto-generated message sent in response to a flagged *accidental* event, but given that I've made several attempts to communicate to you, via this page as well as four or five times thru the original """"vandalism/nonsense"""" (to which to you responded *once*, with, I might add, a tone that was less than in keeping with the tone I see when I read the messages on this page).  Nevertheless, what I was trying to accomplish with the Moline page was to take a wikipedia entry that was woefully lacking and add some real value to it  I had added the the Moline page a """"location"""", """"air travel"""", """"major interstate highways"""", """"sports"""", """"gambling"""", and """"landmarks; and notable bridges"""" sections.  Additionally, I completely revamped the schools section into an """"education"""" section that provided internal and external links to every school mentioned.  You removed all of that.  BTW, I tried to document all of my efforts in the Discussion page, so anyone could see what I was trying to do: make the Moline page better.  Before I found it, it was little more than a glorified rundown of which neighborhood has more Mexicans than the next... and I found it simply too racist to let stand.  Yes, I also was trying to edit the Neighborhood section, to remove the racism, but also better demonstrate the real flavor and history of the town.  Thanks to you, the history and flavor is gone, and the racism is back...  Congratulations.  A final request; if you see fit to keep my efforts out of the wiki, then please be so kind as to be consistent, for I still see the results of my writing on the Moline page.  IF you are going to remove my work and have the Moline page reflect the rants of one racist hick, please be consistent and completely remove all of my work - either keep all of my work in... or none of it.

Re: Giovanni's mother (The Woman Boss)
I see in a recent edit you made to Giovanni that you made a hidden (is that the word? I mean those tags that have the """"!"""" sign in them and are visible only in the edit box) question concerning the bit in the article about Giovanni's mother. (i.e """"WTF is this?"""") It's true that this is not exactly mainstream knowledge, so let me explain:

In Japan, a """"radio drama"""" (which as I understand it is basically a Pokémon episode without the animation) was produced, which was about the story of Mewtwo until the events of the first movie. Part of the radio drama was the short """"Birth of Mewtwo"""" video that also exists in English.

The story is narrated by Giovanni, who tells us about when Team Rocket was led by a very beautiful woman that he then identifies as his mother. This woman is referred to as On'na Boss, meaning the Woman/Female Boss. Jessie's mother Miyamoto, a TR agent, brings to her attention the existence of Mew from a recording in the Andes, and On'na Boss sends her to investigate. Miyamoto eventually finds Mew, but is subsequently lost in an avalanche and never heard of again. The story then continues with Giovanni's own attempts to find Mew one generation later, whose results we all know. Hope this cleared things up without being too long-winded!  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

About the closing of this move request: As noted in the template, above, the closing guidelines are set out at Wikipedia:Requested moves/Closing instructions. In a discussion with  on my talk page today, I misinformed him/her that a no consensus result here necessarily results in the title staying the same. The """"Determining consensus"""" section of those guidelines actually says, among other important things:However, sometimes a requested move is filed in response to a recent move from a long existing name that cannot be undone without administrative help. Therefore, if the closer feels that no consensus has been reached, they may move the article back to the most recent stable name. If the most recent stable name is itself a matter of dispute, closers are expected to use their own judgment in determining the proper destination.Since this article was named History of pottery in the Southern Levant from 22 June 2006 until it was first changed to the current title on 21 October 2011, that provision would seem to clearly apply. I would also note in passing that in light of the serious issues and controversy concerning this issue, the """"Non-admin closure"""" section of those guidelines would appear to not allow a non-admin closure to this discussion.

 Response to the lies in your RFC TAB 

HiTAB 

I posted this response to your RFC on Canaen.TAB I believe you removed it.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a """" snitch """" in American. That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way.TAB 

The funniest thing for me is that you are busy digging a hole in your own canoe because your allegations are lies. You are entirely wrong. I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not. I state """" very minor little offence """" because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant.TAB 
You are an individual of very little decency and integrity. I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement. You have been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or these other individuals and yet you not only continue to go on making such allegations but you even use them as the ground to make an attack on another individual.TAB 
Don't worry, Karma will come and get you in its own time.TAB 
 TAB 
 ==User conduct RFC==TAB 

Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you. It can be found  here. Cheers,  TAB 

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.TAB 

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity.TAB 
 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods.TAB 
I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine.TAB

-TAB:For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently. I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let  get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put  in the same category for his anorexic stuff.TAB 

From my point of view, my objections are largely literary. The article became too bloated and required editing down. It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is. I don't see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism. I don't even support vegan's trying to counter counter-vegan propaganda on the Wiki. It is best to keep it short and simple and give a few links so that folks that are interested can go find out more.TAB

Actually, that policy you cite basically just tells you to not revert banned editors if reverting would restore inappropriate content. If you do so, it's your responsibility. But the section above that talks about how helpful edits do not need to be reverted. Our one goal here is to build an encyclopedia. Reverting positive contributions to the encyclopedia just because a user is banned (or for any procedural reason, for that matter) is counterintuitive. So the general rule in these situations is to use common sense. If the banned user's edit is not helpful, revert. If it's obviously helpful, don't revert (or don't think you need to). If you're not really sure whether it's helpful, you should probably err on the side of caution and revert. But at the end of the day, blindly reverting any addition made by a banned user really doesn't help anyone, and whether to revert or not is left to your own discretion. In this case, there's clearly a disagreement, so I would recommend you explain exactly why you think their edits should remain, and discuss the issue with Hobartimus.

 Followup re TPm case voting, etc 

Courcelles, as your response to my previous query failed to answer the question as to why you would vote on the my topic ban the same day that the FoF was posted by AGK versus your statement to Malke that the """"last thing you needed to do"""" was to vote on her topic ban, etc., I'm wondering what your history of interaction on Wikipedia with Malke has been in the past.

Since it was raised on the Evidence pageby meyou cannot not have been aware of the fact that she was sanctioned for similar behavior in 2010. You also must have been aware of the fact that she had accused me several times of being a sockpuppet of Dylan somebody-or-other, and made other strange assertions, as I detailed on the Evidence page. You seem to have ignored all of the above in your vote regarding sanctions against Malke, and voted for sanctions against me before any discussion of the FoF had even had a chance to take place.

So, I am investigating you, independently, as it were. You may find that amusing, but I have just explained the rationale, and I hope you take me seriously. 

If you'd care to explain what you found most offensive in my editing conduct on that article, it might save me the time an effort of examining your interaction history with Malke to see whether or not maybe you should have recused yourself from the case altogether, or at least from voting on Malke, as NYB did (recuse himself). 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Speaking of objectivity: while what I said regarding the copula was a plausible argument for using the upper case, the fact is that different people capitalize differently in that particular situation.

To judge only """"based on behavior"""" is not right, please. If somebody wants my data, I'll be more than happy to submit it.

However, during the time period that Mary Ambrose was involved with Robert Palmer, she was involved with a number of men, even having two children, in 2001 and 2002, with men known to Robert Palmer. Mary Ambrose's son born in 2001 was fathered by Mick Carter, who was Robert Palmer's manager, until Palmer fired him in the second week of September. Unfortunately, since Mick Carter was the first person to discover that Robert Palmer had died, he took the opportunity to lie to the press on a number of points, including naming Mary Ambrose as Robert Palmer's girlfriend. Robert Palmer was no longer involved with Mary Ambrose before his death. His only contact with her at that point was trying to iron out a settlement agreement with Ambrose ensuring that she would not give interviews about him, or discuss him with the press. Mick Carter was not fond of Robert's true girlfriend, in fact he disliked her intently. Robert Palmer hadn't told many people about Mick Carter's firing, opting to complete his publicity appearances in Paris for Drive before doing so. Carter was fully aware of this, and took advantage of the situation. When it was discovered what he had done, and the surfeit of bogus and incorrect information that he had provided to the press worldwide, the information was invalidated due to his firing and credibility issues. Because of his close friendship with Mary Ambrose, he saw a money making opportunity for them in Robert Palmer's death. Carter even went so far as to stage a 'hoax' interview on Mary Ambrose's behalf, entitled Robert Palmer Was Addicted To My Love. The article appeared on the 28th of September, two days after the death of Palmer. The interview allegedly took place by phone, backed up by a signed release. When the interview was challenged by the family as being false, the interview was basically Robert Palmer emoting about Mary Ambrose, who his children knew he was no longer involved with in any vernacular at the time of his death, the article was revealed to be a hoax. At the time Robert Palmer was allegedly giving this interview by phone, he was in fact in attendance at a social function accompanied by three friends of his, who vouched he was with them the entire time the interview was allegedly taking place. As for the release, it was proven that Robert Palmer's signature was forged, and not a very good forgery at that.

075a4b83f3eba42f,"""Changes to this Page - Open discussion ==
Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to """"be bold"""" and start a """"démenagement"""" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the """"general concensus"""" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.

My goal here is not to """"control"""" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved.

The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general """"Paris"""" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for """"Paris economy"""" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for """"Paris history"""" or """"paris fashion"""". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below.

In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only """"Paris"""" into the search window - I propose to move the more """"specialty"""" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a """"specialty"""" page of its own. This would even be a positive move, as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.

The irony of the sort is that, though I contribute to Wiki, it won't be to this page in any quantity. My specialty is the history of Paris, and I cannot even think to add that knowledge here - Paris' history has a page of its own. Just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.

Here I would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. I hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement - please answer with any ideas you would have. With this post I would also like to """"sound the board"""" - to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page, as what I have seen to date leaves room for doubt. In your answers, I hope for evidence to the contrary. 

Please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all.

When people have moved on to other things and are going on about their business on wiki in an exemplary fashion, do not try and disrupt the peace by gross incivility after many days. This is antithetical to the aims of wiki and will work against wiki. Also it shows how some people are unable to let go of the old settled dead past and hold silly grudges and not remain peaceful.

Thanks for uploading Image:Douglasduncan.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

 BLP, ethnicity, gender 

Remember a couple of years back, when I tried a common subpage for both policy and guidelines? And you objected, so we split them back up?

Well, as I predicted, they've diverged over time. And now the wiki-lawyers are arguing that """"policy"""" trumps """"guidelines"""".  Since the BLP policy doesn't specifically mention Ethnicity and Gender, while at least a half dozen guidelines do, it's been disrupting WP:CFD, and WP:EGRS, and quite a bit else.

Could you take a look at the main (above), and see whether you support adding Ethnicity and Gender into the policy?

Hi Star Mississippi,

We created a great new social network site www.homestayonline.com for homestay enthusiasts. It is the first of its kind in terms of technology features and more including online chat, groups, forums, and more... I think that it is the first of its kind in homestay. I launched on April 9th and so far we have 40 members. I tried to add it a resource page to Wikipedia homestay subject but it was removed. I may have used the wrong method to add it and I apologize but if very tiresome to try again. I wonder if you can help me do right thing or add it for me in the most appropriate manner. I also hope that it would stay, since the HomestayOnline network is expected goal is to grow by minimum 50 members per day by end of 2009.

I would appreciate if you can also log-in my site and see for yourself how this can help everyone. It is free of charge to join...

Ancient Egyptians were Caucasoid

Modern studies on ancient egyptian dentition clusters them with Caucasoids (Europeans, Western Asians) who have small teeth, as opposed to Negroids (Western Sub-Saharan Africans) who have megadont/large teeth.

It's refreshing to see some true civility for a change.  Especially after having had four different admins block me (actually, it's probably more than the last four), without one word of discussion with me from any of them before doing so.  Then there's the whole thing about much of the discussion not being aboveboard, but rather taking place in the modern version of the proverbial smoke-filled back room.

At least not anything close to civility in anything other than a highly ritualized, magic-incantation, Wikipedia-jargon meaning of that term.

Hello!  informed me that you were asking some questions about why the article you wrote, Offley Place, was speedy deleted. As I am the administrator who deleted it, I'll give you some brief rationale according to Wikipedia conventions and policies. I'm glad you have decided to contribute to Wikipedia, and I hope you continue to add to the project in the future. However, the article Offley Place as you wrote it met the criterion for deletion for two reasons:

The article did not indicate why the subject met the criteria for inclusion that apply to businesses and organizations.
It did not contain any verifiable, third-party references.
It was written in a promotional, rather than an encyclopedic tone. 
It appeared that the only contributor to the article (you) had a significant conflict of interest with the article subject. That is, it appears that your reason for adding the article to Wikipedia is to promote your business, rather than to improve the encyclopedic content of Wikipedia.

Though your first article did not meet the standards for inclusion in an encyclopedia, we hope that you will continue as an editor here. For more information about Wikipedia policies and guidelines, I suggest you take a look at the five pillars of Wikipedia. If you have any more questions, please feel free to let me know on my talk page.

And if I'm not mistaken, the Vatican is the major significant party to restrict usage of the Hebrew term among themselves, in favor of non-Hebrew names, for some doctrine of theirs of papal infallibility.  I don't see that as an overriding reason not to use the more specific Hebrew name where it is more appropriate.

Believe that we too love freedom and desire it. To us it is more desirable than anything else in the world. If you strike us down now we shall rise again and renew the fight.

Robert Seymour (illustrator) v. Seymour Controversy 

REF: Fribbler. 19th September 2008. EDIT: (It's not """"the"""" Jane Seymour. It was his wife.) 

The fact of Robert’s wife ( and daughter ) named Jane Seymour, in comparison with “the” Jane Seymour, must be considered when analyzing evidences, motives and causations of Robert’s death. 

“The” Jane Seymour wife of Henry VIII was mother to the last English King Edward VI. (English law forbade matrilineal succession) As determined in the will of Henry VIII, Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (b.1561), his 3 sons; 3 daughters and brother, were all named as successors to the English Throne, (then again after Elizabeth I, and James I.) 

The 1st evidence of a Seymour (Beauchamp) ancestry being usurped* occurred in the German 1st reign (matrilineal descent) of King George 1st. His Prime Minister; Walpole ('his' crest representing the House of Wettin – Queen Victoria) usurped the confiscated McDermott – Beauchamp Arms (Chevron; Cross Crosslet, and motto Dieu et mon Droit.) 

During the childless reign of King William IV, Robert Seymour’s suicide verdict literally determined him as a felon, and for his crime, his properties were forfeited to William IV, for the German 2nd reign (Victoria’s matrilineal descent) of her Sax Coburg-Gotha heirs. 

Thus, the (Seymour) succession of Edward VI; went to (Sax Coburg-Gotha) Edward VII. 24 September 2008 (UTC)

NB: George V (1911): 100 year “Official Secrets Act - Death sentence for Sax Coburg-Gotha disclosures;” (1911 to 2011.)

WilliamJE, I wanted to let you know why I've modified some of your edits. While you're to be commended for trying to pare down Notable people lists, the usual procedure for dealing with unsourced material is to tag it first. This gives other editors notice of the issue and provides them with some time to find reliable sources. If, after some time has passed after a {{cn}} was placed, and no one has provided a citation, then the material can be deleted. In several instances you were very quick to delete material that didn't yet have a source. Yet I was able to quite readily find a source for the deleted material. Deleting material without notice may mean that valid information is deleted from an article because other editors weren't given notice of the issue and time to rectify it. So maybe you want to think about tagging unsourced material, rather than just deleting it. 71.139.157.80",0,0,0,0,0,0

48db16c8180d3c23,"""

Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has admitted that the much loved """"free encyclopedia"""" has at least some quality problems. To some of us, this is nothing new. I've had more than one student rely on Wikipedia for accurate information for a paper, and it always ends up the same way: """"well, I got it off of Wikipedia, thinking it was good..."""".

And therein lies the problem. If you keep in mind that anyone, and I mean anyone, can edit a Wikipedia entry, then you are treading on dangerous ground if you're going to cite it as a source of fact. While it's true that errors often get corrected, they don't always, and what happens in the meantime is that bad info sits there, misinforming people. Of course, this isn't true just in the case of Wikipedia. It's a problem online, in general. I recently was party to an argument over the historicity of Jesus, and one person used a source that claimed that Philo of Alexandria lived in Jerusalem. He's called Philo of Alexandria for a reason, you know.[] 

I used to be such an unadulterated fan of Wikipedia you know. The idea of an open source online reference that grew on a daily basis was quite an attractive one back in the day. But in recent times I've become wary of the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, and not simply because of a few high profile choice edits.

Whatever about libel and congressional cherry picking amidst the many articles of this once noble enterprise, what really gets me about Wikipedia is that I can't trust it on most issues. There are so many agendas, axes to grind and purely mischievous vandals that 90% of what I would be interested in reading about - history, politics and so on - is tripe. To read an article on a contentious subject one can pick out bias, attempted compromise and ultimate failure almost immediately. Wade into the """"Talk"""" page, where these edits are discussed, and you are confronted with chaos. There are too many vested interests at stake, and from the War on Terror to the Welfare State one will find an army of people taking one view or another entering into what are known as """"Revert Wars"""", where they revert any edits back to the version which suits them.

From self-interest to political interest one can find """"POV"""" (Point of View) shading almost every major article that touches on the live wires of our society. Thus I wouldn't trust anything that's even half-way current or ongoing on Wikipedia.

For one, the facts can be skewed. Secondly, the article can change overnight depending on how organised a campaign is launched against an article (and they do happen.)

However, my statement was not only on Rockall, but the article in general including the map and your position that we need to copy the style of academic literature. Read it again and point out where I mention Rockall. I simply pointed out the fallacy in your argument for excluding Rockall (which from 1955 to 1972 was a possession and not anything like a county Sussex) and that your example again indicates overall how you would wish the article written.

As for Rjensen's comments, maybe he should then explain the various uninhabitable rocks possessed by Australia, the United Kingdom, and in particular the United States (e.g. Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Rockall, Baker Island, Howland Island, Johnston Atoll, Navassa Island and all the other United States Minor Outlying Islands). Empire does not only deal with people and governments it also deals with territory and the status of the territory in relation to the possessing country.

 Thanks DocJames for updating the article.  To the anonymous contributor, the article you reference states """"Men taking finasteride may not have an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Adjusting for the known effects that finasteride has on prostate cancer detection, investigators estimated that high-grade tumors (Gleason scores 7–10) were no more likely in the men taking finasteride than in the men taking placebo. However, because very few prostate cancers were detected at Gleason scores of 8 to 10, it is difficult to draw conclusions about this group.""""
From this text, I think it would be appropriate to say something like - In contrast to the FDA's stance, the National Cancer Institute believes that finasteride may increase the ability to detect cancer which accounts for the higher prevalance of high-grade cancer.

3b3923c3aa972ed3,"Another Explanation of the Error

Before we open any envelopes, it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that if the envelopes are said contain A and 2A (without distinguishing which envelope contains which amount), then all values of A are equally likely − because we have no better information. However, it does not then follow from this assumption that, given A is found in the first envelope, the other envelope is equally likely to contain (1/2)A or 2A for every conceivable value of A (which is something we have implied in the subsequent calculation of expected value). 

Why?

Because, for any specific amount of money from which to fill the envelopes, given we have found A in the first envelope, for all values of A we can always find (1/2)A in the second envelope, whereas it is only possible to find 2A in the second envelope half the time.

See it like this: If the specific amount of money is M say, then we can find A to have any value up to (2/3)M, but the second envelope can only contain 2A for values of A up to (1/3)M ie. half as often.

So, given A was found in the first envelope, the chance of finding (1/2)A in the second envelope is 2/3, and the chance of having 2A in the second envelope is 1/3 − not equal as we had assumed, even though all values of A are still being assumed to be equally likely.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Dear DCstats and ERosa 

Starting a new section here because the preceding is hopelessly indented.

DCstats and ERosa, you are mistaken in your thinking. Jdannan and Avenue are quite correct. I know this might be very difficult for you to accept. You claim to have references supporting your interpretation. However, I think you are misinterpreting the statements from the textbooks you are reading. I can't speak for your """"petroleum industry statistican"""" friend. My guess is that you conveyed your misinterpretation of the situation to him/her. I have a ph.d. in mathematics and after reading this talk page and thinking I was almost losing my mind, I consulted with several other ph.d. mathematician and statistician friends of mine who confirmed that Jdannan and Avenue are indeed correct. And the interpretation given in the article is basically correct as well. In fact, it's the interpretation I've seen given in every stats book I've looked at.

Some references, since these seem to be very important to people:

""""Warning! There is much confusion about how to interpret a confidence interval. A confidence interval is not a probability statement about θ since θ is a fixed quantity, not a random variable."""" — Larry Wasserman, All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, p. 92
""""CAUTION! A 95% confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ. Remember, probability describes the likelihood of undetermined events. Therefore, it does not make sense to talk about the probability that the interval contains μ, since the population mean is a fixed value. Think of it this way: Suppose I flip a coin and obtain a head. If I ask you to determine the probability that the flip resulted in a head, it would not be 0.5, because the outcome has already been determined. Instead the probability is 0 or 1. Confidence intervals work the same way. Because μ is already determined, we do not say that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ."""" — Michael Sullivan III, Statistics: Informed Decisions Using Data, p. 453
""""The idea of interval estimation is complicated; an example is in order. Suppose that, for each λ, x is a real random variable normally distributed about λ with unit variance; then, as is very easy to see with the aid of a table of the normal distribution, if M(x) is taken to be the interval [x − 1.9600, x + 1.9600], then (1) P(λ in M(x) | λ) = α, where α is constant and almost equal to 0.95. It is usually thought necessary to warn the novice that such an equation as (1) does not concern the probability that a random variable λ lies in a fixed set M(x). Of course, λ is given and therefore not random in the context at hand; and given λ, α is the probability that M(x), which is a contraction of x, has as its value an interval that contains λ."""" — Leonard J. Savage, The Foundations of Statistics, p. 260

Your misunderstanding seems to be based on an inadequate grasp of a few facts:

 The population mean μ is a fixed constant, not a random variable.
 The endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables, not fixed constants.
 A statement about the level of confidence of a confidence interval is a probabilistic statement about the endpoints of the interval considered as random variables.

The issue about whether μ is """"known"""" or not is a complete red herring. What matters is that μ is fixed, not whether it's """"known"""". This also has absolutely nothing to do with probabilistic interpretations of quantum physics, good lord.

Let me go through an example which has the most simplifying assumptions. Suppose we have a normally distributed random variable X  on a population with mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ = 16, and suppose we select samples of size n = 100. Then the sample mean X-bar is a sampling distribution defined on the space of all possible samples of size 100, and it has mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ/sqrt(n) = 16/sqrt(100) = 16/10 = 1.6. A 95% confidence interval for μ based on this sampling is then given by (X-bar − zα/2*σ/sqrt(n), X-bar + zα/2*σ/sqrt(n)) = (X-bar − (1.96)*1.6, X-bar + (1.96)*1.6) = (X-bar − 3.136, X-bar + 3.136).

Now, note the following facts:

 The confidence interval is defined to be a random interval, i.e. the endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables defined in terms of the sample mean X-bar.

You are new here and you don't understand the rules very well, much less the spirit that informs them - it is very very unwise to jump straight into a heated dispute as you are doing on the Michael Greger article.  Per the notice above you are edit warring, and if you continue doing that you are going to drive right over a cliff and get blocked.  So really  my advice to you is slow down and learn how we operate (and really learn!).  Ask questions about the relevant wikipedia policies and guidelines that govern our content.

I am sorry about this, but if you really want to get involved, it turns out that Wikipedia is a pretty complex place.  Being an """"encyclopedia that anyone can edit"""" means that over the years, Wikipedia has developed lots of policies and guidelines (PAG) to help provide a """"body of law"""" as it were, that form a foundation for rational discussion.  Without that foundation, this place would be a wild west -  a truly ugly place, where people would just make shit up, about why some content should or should not be in an article, and it would devolve into a bar room brawl.   But with the foundation, there are ways to rationally work things out - if, and only if, all the parties involved accept that foundation and work within it.  One of the hardest things for new people, is to understand not only that this foundation exists, but what its letter and spirit is. (I keep emphasizing the spirit, because too often people fall prey to what we call """"wikilawyering"""")   The more I have learned about how things are set up here - not just the letter of PAG and the various drama boards and administrative tools, but their spirit -  the more impressed I have become at how, well ... beautiful this place is.   It takes time to learn both the spirit and the letter of PAG, and to really get aligned with Wikipedia's mission to crowdsource a reliable, NPOV source of information for the public (as """"reliable"""" and """"NPOV"""" are defined in PAG!).   People come edit for many reasons, but one of the main ones is that they are passionate about something.  That passion is a double-edged sword.  It drives people to contribute which has the potential for productive construction, but it can also lead to WP:TENDENTIOUS editing, which is really destructive.  WP:ADVOCACY is one of our biggest bedevilments. 

So don't edit war - discuss on the talk page. Ask authentic questions, not rhetorical ones, about what policies and guidelines are relevant to the content you care about.  good luck.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Translations: Translations of song titles should be real translations! Official dictionaries should be used to get correct translations. In the case of リンガ・フランカ the official English translation is """"lingua franca"""".

The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclopædidia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch aritlce in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): """"But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God."""" It is cited in  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: Moloch] with the comment: """"Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away."""" The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the """"statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live"""" (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.
It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding """"as some hold"""". This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.

Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at . The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so.

There is a discussion at  which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.

In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem pasage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. On could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress.

The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. 

Your particular POV on a Biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.

I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.

It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions.

I am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound",0,0,0,0,0,0

As for the articles which caused people to attack and harass me, nothing regarding these articles was ever properly done.  No messages asking to discuss it, no polls done to find out which information is correct, no editing done after my edits for the purpose of further improving the article, nothing constructive or reasonable whatsoever, just reverting the entire edit without discussion or reasonableness, lying about the reason for reverting, harassment, and making fraudulent claims against me such as """"adding information without sources"""", regardless of the fact that 1) I did not ADD any information to the article and 2) it is okay to add information that does not have  a source, and most new articles consist mainly, and some entirely, of such information.  Someone wrote something about """"friendly advice,"""" but not a SINGLE related comment was at all """"friendly,"""" and no advice was given whatsoever except for one which was both unhelpful and contained more untrue statements.  Even this administrator is purposefully making blatantly fraudulent statements, claiming that I """"ignored guidelines in regards to my signature"""", regardless of the fact that the one who changed Wikipedia's code to no longer link automatically is not me, nor did they notify me, nor could anyone think of a reasonable reason to do this, regardless of the fact that it has been less then 24 hours since anyone requested that I learn programming code and then re-code my signature to compensate for this flaw, that's right less then 24 hours let alone a reasonable time of 4 months or so (assuming the user has logged in for several hours every day during that time), and regardless of the fact that even in that minuscule amount of time my signature had already been re-coded before he ever did this block.  This shows that the administrator himself is specifically in bad faith by citing an alleged """"problem"""" that no longer even exists.  There is also a log of the LITERAL AND DIRECT EXACT OPPOSITE of the claim of the person who reported me (again, WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME TO REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE MATTER), at the Help Desk page.  I advise that people looking at this do not read that conversation as evidence of replies and such, because several of my replies were deleted before the conversation was archived and therefore it is an invalid archive, BUT it does show the exact opposite of this claim in that I specifically complained about someone for doing that very thing because the conversation between MYSELF AND HIM should be done at only ONE place, and should also be done at one of the appropriate pages, rather then being harassive by using different places as this Administrator is claiming I have done when there is direct evidence that I've done the opposite.  So the main thing being that I am the victim of numerous people attacking me, they should not have attacked me but instead should have done any of the things I mentioned, or some other reasonable thing, rather then reverting edits and then attacking and harassing me.  I did not deserve any such harassment and attacks and do have the right to defend such things.

The question at hand is whether these are true facts that are pertinent to this Wikipedia page and thus deserve to be judged by the people who read it. This is, after all, a page in the Wikipedia and not your personal property. Is that not so? These facts are as follows:

1) Substantial numbers of horses which show many characteristics of purebred Appaloosas have been found in 2014 living in a remote mountain valley of Kyrgyzstan near the Chinese border. These horses exhibit spots, white sclerae, and striped hooves.

2) a DNA analysis conducted by Dr. Gus Cothran at Texas A & M University shows that these Kyrgyzstan horses closely match purebred  American Appaloosas in their genetics.

3) As of 2015, controversy exists as to whether these horses should be considered true Appaloosas. A BBC documentary shows the 69-year-old female New Zealand Appaloosa breeder who rode horseback over a 13,777 foot mountain pass to find these horses. This documentary clearly shows these horses in their native milieu and discusses the DNA evidence.

Now Mr. Montanabw Sir, are those facts not true?  Are they not germane? People come to this Wikipedia Appaloosa page to learn current and pertinent facts about Appaloosas. In that context neither your opinion nor mine count for a plug nickel.

Therefore I will now repeat my question . Exactly why are you continuing to refuse the addition of these facts to this Wikipedia page? If you wish, I don't see why an additional section cannot be added entitled """"Kyrgyzstan horse controversy"""" containing this information. Can you? 

Because if we can't resolve this question here, that is the issue I am going to ask the next level to resolve. I will not ask them to decide about LP genes or whether the BBC has made up some fairy story about the Appaloosa or whether the moon is made of green cheese. I will ask them whether you are in your legitimate rights to deny the inclusion of this information to the Wikipedia readers. Am I speaking clearly enough, Mister?

It would be difficult to classify tools based on both their intended and unintended purpose, but at the same time screw drivers are very frequently misused to pry open containers of paint.
I haven't found any source classifying (or even defining well enough to make a category) tools either. I think we might be best off creating our own definitionnot in the sense of original research, but purely for the purpose of better organizing the encyclopedia. Here's a thought (just a rudimentary idea): let's say there are passive and active tools. Passive tools create no tangible effectthese are measuring devices, ladders, flashlights, stools, clamps (unless they are used for crushing), jacks, beakers, tape recorders(?). Active tools have a tangible effect: drills, pencils, hammers, nail clippers, spatulas, shovels. In general tools act on a material (although not necessarily a specific material, like a flashlight will act on most things): pencils act on paper, egg beaters act on eggs, saws on wood or metal, caulk guns on caulk, paint brushes on paint, beakers on chemicals. So consider a container of correction fluid: the little brush on the inside of the lid is the active tool, the container is the passive tool and the whiteout is the material. These are just some philosophical thoughts I worked and might give us somewhere to start.   01:14, 8",0,0,0,0,0,0

9c7504b5e02b296e,"""One of my friends, whose father was second senior commander in the Israeli Intelligence Service and involved in the Raid on Entebbe Airport, is now a senior Minister in the Israeli Government. I've instructed them to find and kill the people named below and Mr Ken Winn-Pope who has tried to have me killed several times and told thousands of lies about me. Mosaad don't mind the real Al-Qaeda helping them to kill these satanic monsters they agree they are the common enemy not the Americans, Moslems, Christians or Jews. I want them dead their head blown off their shoulders or burnt to death for what I've witnessed they've done to Thai people. My friend Ronnie in the Israeli Government has known me for about nine years, they will be killed that is 100% guaranteed http://thailand.ahrchk.net/takbai/ part 3 ... some of the people in this film were friends of mine, 150 young men in total killed all innocent people killed by Shinwatra_sylvester-Napier-Cowell's satanic mafia... they were there thinking I was going to arrive to get rid of the problem (the satanists) but I did not know they'd gone there to wait for me... they've killed most of my friends in Thailand most are now dead.

I have met a group of the real Al-Qaeda terrorists in Asia about two years ago and told them who had lied to them about the Americans and how they'd been tricked and brainwashed, the Americans are not satanic. Ive given them the names of the people that terrorised my life and asked them to kill these people who are satanists which includes a man called Winn-Pope whom I believe lied to my wife to turn her against me. Bob Craig-Wood is another name they've been given as well as the Shinawatra-Sylvester family all of whom are satanists. These families kill children and young people to get rich. I was physically (many times) and mentally tortured in Thailand due to their lies http://thailand.ahrchk.net/takbai/ part 3 this is the work of The Shinawatra family (former WW2 Gestapo families descendants who claimed to be Thai by stealing other people's IDs)... they've killed many thousands of Thai children during the past ten years many many many and tortured many young innocent people to death in the most unimaginable tortures you could never believe someone could think of using, very very very evil... They strapped one girl under a truck then drove it flat out down a highway to petrify her into submission/obedience, others they did this to were petrified to death, very very very evil creatures never trust the Shinawatra Sylvester mafia and their associates Ken Winn-Pope aka John Berisford aka Richard Irwin and he's also claimed to be me.... he is one of the people that helped arranged the game of """"rape"""" in Bangkok many girls their lives ruined by this game an absolutely terrible man.. there have been several cases where they wired a 18-23 year old man up to the mains electricity and electrocuted him for up to nine hours with the cables connected to his private parts, I heard one time this happened and searched furiously to find out where they were doing this in Bangkok. I also heard them torturing very young children physically torturing them for many many hours.. so do not think I am a bad person asking for these satanists to be killed unless you do not care about children and young people who've done nothing whatsoever to deserve to be tortured (there is no justification for torture)..

I lived in Thailand for many years and believe The Spirit World exists... I have witnessed many sureal and extraordinary things happening, sadly some very very bad things... If you have a problem in Barbados then advise your police about my comments below it may help all of you solve the problem..... The British do not understand that Satanism exists nor do they understand The Spirit World exists and is used by satanists (Home Sapiens Satan) to harm (Homo Sapiens Human) human beings. It is not unlawful to kill satanists they are no different to a dangerous rabied dog, therefore it is not the crime of murder or manslaughter to kill them. You can train dogs to """"sniff out satanists"""" just like they can detect drugs.

I happen to be from Ontario and in Ontario the Regions are spending many Billions of dollars on public tenders each year inviting only a few friends and keeping all others from getting their work or making money from their work if they get one. The few invited friends are mostly companies who could not compete in open tender and can only get the work from taking non-elected public officials golfing and god knows what else. All that is evident is that public works cost up to 100% or more than it should and they are not subject to Auditor General control. The public money is mostly wasted this way forcing our taxes here to keep escalating out of control. I don't know about other parts of the world, but most honest democratic countries have checks and balances in place. Not in the Regions of Ontario which is basically one big networked secret organization where they are pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars by things like not conducting completive (and no tender at all sometimes) so they can help their friends get high prices for their public works contracts. I picked Peel as examples out because they are the biggest and wasting the most money each year.

Dear Yiyu,

Don't work too much on the Mao article here  whatever you agree on will have no real strength behind it because you are not working with other editors, and when you polish something together, it will ultimately be destroyed by those that had no part in it.

You also need to watch out for what wikipedia calls """"weasel terms"""" that are used in the draft above.   """"weasel terms"""" are ways of saying thing that really avoid the issue.  If an editor says """"some analysts believe"""", it really means """"I don't know who believes it, but I want it in this article"""".

Unfortunately, the current wiki has no way to decide """"truth"""" and """"lies"""".   The best you can do is present all sides (not just one, or two) and cite evidence.     For everything that is a lie, you can add sentences describing why it is untrue.  There have been some movements to give weight to editors that are educated in one area more than those that are just shooting their mouths off, but they have failed.  As we all know, many times history has been distorted and many people have been fooled, so don't be too sure that you know what really happened, when all most of us really have are hand-me-down stories.

Lastly, be sure not to get too wrapped up in articles.  Find other articles to edit and your experience will be much more fulfilling.   Come to visit Mao often, and put it on your watchlist, but don't let it consume you or sour you on wikipedia.   I can guarantee you that 10 years from now, there will STILL be edit wars on the Mao page.  Working through the night to make a perfect article won't stop someone from getting up in the morning and ruining your delicate balancing act.  You probably have great insight into many things that are completely uncovered in Wiki  give those a try sometime.

The markets, were nervous about the new face and to prove that he could be tough on inflation like Volker, Greenspan tightened the money supply after he took over, resulting in higher interest rates.

Discussion
I prefer to act transparently. Can I give my views on that determination here?  insignis 
 I sent you an email message asking for your opinion. I think that is pretty transparent.   
 That is fine with me, but some editors don't like it. It was a neutral invitation to a discussion, but it would be more open on a talk page - I did have the wikibreak sign up though. Thanks for the message though, I didn't notice the discussion start.  insignis 
 I wrote it in an email message when possible because those kinds of notification are not worth writing on user talk pages – since there is nothing to talk about. However, in two cases the users' had no email listed and in those cases I did write it on their talk page. See User_talk:Sarsaparilla#Review_of_deletion_of_page_User:Prester_John and User_talk:Christopher_Mann_McKay#User:Prester_John. I did not know that policy you linked to. Thanks for that.   
That is a good point, no reply is necessary. By the way, it is not a policy, rather a 'behavioural guideline' - I hope it is helpful. Regards,  insignis

GA review (see here for what the criteria are, and here for what they are not)
, I've completed a thorough and comprehensive review and re-review of your article, and I find that it meets the criteria outlined for passage to Good Article status. Prior to its passage, however, I have shared below some comments and questions that should first be addressed. It has been a privilege to review this article and I look forward to your feedback. Thanks!   (talk) 
It is reasonably well written.
a (prose, no copyvios, spelling and grammar):  b (MoS for lead, layout, word choice, fiction, and lists): 
 
It is factually accurate and verifiable.
a (reference section):  b (citations to reliable sources):  c (OR): 
 
It is broad in its coverage.
a (major aspects):  b (focused): 
 
It follows the neutral point of view policy.
Fair representation without bias: 
 
It is stable.
No edit wars, etc.: 
 
It is illustrated by images and other media, where possible and appropriate.
a (images are tagged and non-free content have fair use rationales):  b (appropriate use with suitable captions): 
 
Overall: 
Pass/Fail: 
 

Lede
 The image of the play's book cover is appropriately tagged with a """"Media data and Non-free use rationale"""" and a book cover copyright license. This is therefore acceptable for inclusion in this article. 
 The template is beautifully formatted and its contents are either cited in the template or in the article's prose.
 Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section, the lede is stands alone as a concise overview of the article. The lead defines the play, establishes context for the play, explains why the play is notable, and summarizes the most important points of the play.
 Blackrock should be bolded AND italicized in its first mention in the lede paragraph, as it is a formal title of a published work, like A Property of the Clan.
 The lede is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no further comments or questions for this section.

Plot
 This is a minor suggestion, but eleven can be rendered 11 here, which would make it consistent with 18th birthday and 15-year-old. 
 The three boys are arrested for the sexual assault, but not also for her murder? If they are also arrested for her murder, this should be stated here.
 Consider rephrasing as """"he grabbed a rock and struck her.""""
 I'd consider adding a comma in the natural pause following """"In the play's last scene...""""
 Also consider rephrasing as """"asks his cousin Cherie to throw [or dispose of] the vehicle's keys into ocean when she goes out surfing."""" Dump seems like a word to use when disposing of a larger item.
 This section is otherwise well-written and I have no further comments or questions for this section.

Development
 Newcastle should be wiki-linked to Newcastle, New South Wales here for those of us unfamiliar with NSW's second most populated area.
 """"Lee's family, who had learned of the play"""" would probably flow better.
 Freewheels is now italicized in the first paragraph of the """"Reception of A Property of the Clan"""" subsection. Since it is not italicized elsewhere, I would suggest making it consistent throughout the prose.

880d89ab74ad3b2c,"""== Literal text ==
I have changed """"According to the literal text of the constitution, the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen of Australia."""" to refer to Queen Victoria instead. I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law.

Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister, who is undeniably the head of government, even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the Governor-General from a cursory reading of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but the truth is that this body does not exist.

Please, if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution, either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong - you will search in vain for the title """"Queen of Australia"""", for example - or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title """"Queen of Australia"""" was introduced.  23:44, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Skyring - It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view - """"I did this to make a point!"""". A point about """"literal"""" text is make by using the adjective """"literal"""". Your point belongs elsewhere.

Anyway, the literal text does not mention """"Queen Victoria"""" it mentions the """"Queen"""". It further states that the """"Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time"""". This is what I has done. Maybe, there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution, but """"Queen Victoria""""! That's wrong, wrong, wrong!

Is it? Have you checked the original? I think that you will find that instead of checking, you jumped in with some more untruths. Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I notice you haven't responded to this. Have you checked the original? This is in Parliament House, and is on public didplay.  00:04, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes I have checked: www.foundingdocs.gov.au

""""Not found The page you requested is not available at this address."""" I suggest you check the original. I have.  00:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought, go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this!. It just wastes time. Also, when you say """"Please!"""", """"Read the constitution"""", you are showing contempt for others. 
 01:02, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia, then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

If you refer to the """"literal text"""" of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a """"Queen of Australia,"""" and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution.  01:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I explained the substitution logic above and applied it. Then skyring put in """"Queen Victoria"""" !!! So I reduced it to just just """"Queen"""" (ie no substiution.) I have no problem either way.  11:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Let's stick with the Queen, shall we? That's probably the best bet.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I thought the point about literal text had been made, but I see that it has not been appreciated. The Constitution does not state that the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen. If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition, then by all means do so, but don't go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there, when it clearly isn't.  23:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement """"the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen"""". Nowhere. s2 states """"A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative"""". That is a clear statement of intention. I noted s101 previously, which states: """"There shall be an Inter-State Commission"""". There is not an Inter-State Commission, so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the Governor-General is now the Queen's representative, given the example",0,0,0,0,0,0

Notability of Dieagram
 A tag has been placed on Dieagram requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  Blanchardb-•MyEars•MyMouth-timed """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 My Conrtibutions to Shady Records 

So I've been asked to consult this page by JrPut or idk his name; but anyway:

The Shady Producers/DJ's list should be updated.
I have valid links for Mr. Porter, Alchemist, Rikanatti, and Luis Resto. The following are all Reliable links, and even though Aftermath Ent. Blog is a blog, we have used it as multible sources on additional articles, and we have also used MTV News as a reliable source, and that in itself is a blog.
 Alchemist 
Luis Resto
Rikanatti
Eminem also acts as a producer for the label, and since he is the founder, CEO, and signed to the label as its main artist, I would presume that linking references for him as a producer is frivalous and uneeded. 

Now, The Bass Brothers and Eminem have ended their working relationship. We have multible sources for this including when Em purchased his new studio, and F.B.T sued Interscope/Aftermath.

However, with that said, we have no additional proof that DJ Head has ended his working relationship with EM. We have no source saying that he has, and unless you supply one, we're going to be leaving him in the active section. Just because a producer didn't release any tracks for the label in a while does not constitute their absence from the label.

So Please, Let me re-add Alchemist, Eminem, Mr. Porter, Luis Resto, Rikanatti, and DJ Head to the production list, and let us move on with our lives. No need to keep pricking this crap in the butt.

""""Omega and Chaos""""

In a certain mythology not known as of yet... omega and chaos are believed to be spirits of the Earth. Omega being the """"protector"""" or """"guardian"""" of Earth, and chaos being the """"armageddon"""" or """"end"""" of Earth.
Supposodely when chaos and desolence is about the Earth or is bought forth upoun the Earth Omega is awakened to balance out the excess...

And vice versa is omega awakens with the goal of sending the planet to the """"stars"""" chaos comes to balance out the excess... so there isn't really a bad guy in this situation...

Whatever  this has precisely nothing to do with the topic of """"Alpha and Omega (Christianity)"""". Go to Alpha and Omega (disambiguation) and see if anything there is relevant (if you can document your assertions, of course...)  

Omega is NOT """"protector"""" NOR """"guardian"""" of Earth, because Sampi instead really bears this function. Remember that Greek alphabet has over 30 letters. 91.94.153.30  
....this guy is just spewing from Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus. Koromon survived intact. 

Alpha and Sampi

Full global Greek alphabet is as follows:

Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ϝ Ϛ Ζ Η Ͱ Θ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Ο Π Ϻ Ϸ Ϟ Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ Ω Ͳ

It begins with Alpha, and ends with Sampi. That means that Omega in this case is not final letter, because after Omega is placed too Sampi. Due to this fact, in this case God is not only local Ionian Alpha and Omega, because He is in this case too Somebody more - global Pan-Greek Alpha and Sampi. This fact should be acknowledged by all Christians that uses global Greek Alphabet, because in this case they can diminish God by excluding Him from full range of global Greek Alphabet. Ionians were justified by their unknowledge, and Jesus only adjusted Himself to their lower level of knowledge, calling Himself as local Ionian Beginning and End. Sho was placed between San and Qoppa and was only existing Greek letter not used by Greeks, but by Bactrians that adopted Greek alphabet. Comparison page is here.  

I'm sorry, but """"Sampi"""" was a kludge whereby a corrupt form of an archaic letter (formerly between Pi and Qoppa) was dragged in so that there would be 27 distinct symbols for the purposes of Isopsephy, while Sho was used in Central Asia to transcribe non-Greek languages. Neither of these symbols was ever used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language (which is the only thing which is relevant for the Bible).  

Thus that would mean that Sampi was corrupted version of San, that is placed between Pi and Qoppa.  

Probably it was (though there is still some debate over the matter). But regardless of its origin, it still was never used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language (which is the only thing that's relevant for this article).  

Because T-shaped alphabetic Sampi was introduced recently to Wikipedia, I think that it is in T-shape not corrupted, but fully fledged letter. For proof look into Sampi article to compare alphabetic T-Sampi and numeric C-Sampi. As you see, T-Sampi is more like russian П and too Greek PI, with addition of |, while C-Sampi is more like russian Э and too Greek LUNATE EPSILON, with addition of -. In this way T-Sampi should be primary, and C-Sampi secondary. CBMIBM  
It's a fully-fledged numerical symbol, but it wasn't a """"letter"""", and it's not relevant to this article.   
T-shaped Sampi was really alphabetic letter with ss value, what is stated even in Greek alphabet article in obsolete letter section, but C-shaped Sampi is mainly numerical symbol derived from previous alphabetic symbol. CBMIBM  
In other words, it was probably a medieval manuscript ligature (disigma, or sigma-sigma) identified at a late period with an archaic numerical symbol (sampi)  as was exactly the case with the medieval manuscript ligature stigma (sigma-tau) identified at a late period with an archaic numerical symbol (digamma).

Yes, bands do play during parades. And yes, parades still take during war. This text is from a published article, your doubts are only WP:OR and not enough to contradict the source. It is not just claimed by the Pakistani naval officer. It is a claim of a Pakistani naval officer quoted by an Indian airforce officer confirming it with his claims that the airforce pilots who made those attacks. The article is written by an Indian officer if you haven't checked yet. These claims are from both sides. You are only replying with WP:OR & WP:IDONTLIKEIT & WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT. The word controversy represents this clash of claims. Since the other citations have not mentioned or refuted it yet this Indian source claims it, it is a controversy.

What a childish comment towards editors who were simply following Wikipedia policy, requiring reliable sources does not make one a """"mirthless deletionist"""", and when your reliable media outlets appear I look forward to reading them.

40a063a5f5a9a360,"Yes there may well be a small number of law firm articles which do not have a complete list of offices, but the overwhelming majority do, as you will have no doubt have discovered yourself in your search. I don't believe that we should base our editing decisions on the quality (or lack thereof) of the Haynes and Boone PR office, who arguably should not have been editing that article in the first place anyhow.

 My firm belief is that details of the office locations of a law firm are essential to properly understanding that firm. If a firm has ten offices in the United States it could have ten offices in Kansas, ten offices in California, ten offices in New York or ten offices spread across Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Fransico, Dallas, Washington etc. In each case it would be a very different firm. 

 The same is true of the UK. Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and London are all very different legal markets, and are all very different again from Croydon, Oxford, Norwich or Brighton. The location of the offices is very important in understanding the market that the firm is operating in - in my view it is as important as the number of lawyers, the turnover of the firm and the profits per partner.

 Again, I completely accept that at a certain point it becomes impractical to list all of a firm's offices in their Wikipedia article. That is clearly the case for PwC, with over 750 offices. I personally do not feel that 69 offices is an excessively large number to detail however, and the revised format of the list now takes up only a few lines in the article.

 Please consider that you are seeking to reduce the sum total of information available to Wikipedia readers. How do readers benefit from the deletion of this information? I can't see any way in which they do. And how do they gain? Again, I can't see any way in which they do. The information is correct, is cited and is factual. It helps readers' understanding of the firm. It is no more advertising than the article of a car manufacturer giving details of the cars that it makes.

 I appreciate that I am outnumbered in this particular discussion but do feel strongly that as a point of principal law firm articles should be allowed to have details of office locations, and that to not allow this would be to single out law firms and treat them differently to many other commerical organisations on wikipedia where far more extensive details of their products and services are allowed. The number of articles, replete with attractive photos and impressive performance details of BMW cars is for example very large: List of BMW vehicles. I have no particular problem with this, but wonder why law firms in general, and this law firm in particular, are being singled out for so much harsher treatment here.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi there TripWire, though I understand that you may have strong opinions about Balochistan, or Pakistan, or both, resorting to personal attacks as you have here where you mock another user's English skills, or here where you attempt to denigrate another user by calling him a little girl, are not constructive.

1. I will not even move my finger to source anything of that BS, I didn't put it there. You put it there without any sources at first, them addede electronic unrelated sources, then changed to printed ones, and all the while, when sources kept changing the text stayed the same to the word! You invented this """"fact"""" and how it relates to the whopping 4.4%, so the only thing I am asking, show the relation of massacre to the 4.4% with verbatum citatons from the source. You asked my above about Subtelny's quote, I did it, now it is your turn to support your outlandish claims with facts. I am curious as to how the massacre relates to the whopping 4.4%?  
2. Then second question arises, why particularly this region with this tiny Russian minority is mentioned while others, for example Zhytomyr oblast with almost double the number of Russians in Volhynia is overlooked? That again highlights the real reason, why this BS is here - a revenge for mentioning ethnic cleansing of Crimean Tatars. (WP:POINT). If you and Russianname are concearned with the plight of etnic Russians in Western Ukraine, why almost the same number of Russians in Transcarpathia, and even the higher number of Russians in Lviv Oblast have been overlooked? Is that because these numbers could not be used in childish revenge, while Volyn ones, even if they are way lower, can? (WP:POINT)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You are repeating the behavior this discussion page has seen in the past 24-48, censoring, maligning and mischaracterizing persons due to political and religious POVs of yourself. Duh, that's what happens in Discussion pages about religious denominations and political candidacies. Your action and your comments here are almost astute, but not quite: The article about Temple Lot was created by a member of the Temple Lot faction, Jared Smith, and and has been constructively edited by his older brother Jordan Smith, who is also an active member of the Temple Lot faction. Not a """"former member"""" or an """"excommunicated"""" member, but a full baptised member, """"in good standing"""" according to the bylaws and official documentation both within and outside the faction. Due mainly to the machinations and malice of an anonymous editor, Good Ol'factory (whom you know perfectly well is the same as the Snocrates/Zoporific who began unconstructively editing the Temple Lot articles in December 2007), both Temle Lot members/Wikipedia Editors Jared Smith and Jordan Smith have been unfairly and abusively banned from editing Wikipedia. Specifically, Administrator Versageek banned Jordan Smith on December 17, 2007 because he kept complaining about Snocrates/Good Ol'factory's misconduct, and then when Snocrates-turned  Good Ol'factory was finally granted administrative privileges, he deleted jsmith51389's user page, which contained a clear explanation of what had happened in December 2007. Duh, that's what dishonest persons do, to hide their misconduct from review: they censor it. I'm mildly curious what pompous and unreasonable and unfair and abusive reply or action you will come up with in reply here, but I'm not terribly curious, seeing as how it's rather predictable whatever pompous, self-rightous """"authorities"""" do when their misconduct is brought to light: Slander the person or persons who bring the misconduct to light, that's what they do.  Nice try, but no cigar, sir. The truth about the Latter-day Saint Movement, and the fascinating role Hedrickites such as Jared Smith and Jordan Smith have played in it, will come to light, whether you, or Snocrates/Good Ol'Factory or any other pious geek, wishes otherwise.

Wikipedia:WikiProject_Drugs
I need to start a project that automates factual changes/insertions (like rambot).  A lot of incorrect information exists in or basic factual information is missing from drug related articles.  This is stuff that can be easily looked up online and are basic scientific facts for which there is no argument over.  The information can be found from several online drug databases including rxlist.com, medlineplus.gov, the official websites of drug manufacturers (they have free, detailed information sheets) and other various websites.

I plan on writing a bot which can automatically 'rip' factual information (which is non-copyrightable due to its factual nature) and create an off-site database.  I will offer this database for free for people to download, so both they and I can work on bots that can integrate the information in articles.

This would require considerable collaboration with the drugs wikiproject people to provide a standard format for all drugs articles beyond the simplistic efforts taken so far so that I can ensure the bot will behave properly and insert information only in a correct manner.

For clarity, this is information regarding side effects, [bio]chemistry, routes of administration, drug names (brand name and genericmy bot will autmoatically look up International Nonproprietary Name, USAN, BAN and other names) as well as other clearly factual things.

A question needs to be raised regarding drug pages, how should they be organized?  The full information sheets on drugs are very large and rather complicated from a lay person's perspective, perhaps it would make sense to integrate full infomration (including the results of studies on it) on a separate """"full information"""" page while keeping the main page a summary?
Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Supreme Court cases
Some of the SCOTUS articles (Lawrence v. Texas, Bowers v. Hardwick) have caught my interest and I may decide to do some bot automation with them also, but I'm not sure what yet.  There are various large legal database websites available which I can legally rip information from in the same manner as with the drug project above.

- In 2004, the dems and their LIBERAL enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Viet Nam, figuring it gave Kerry an edge. So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth, it was! LOL! (With additional props to Dan Rather.)

- In 2006, the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge.

- And thanks to Senator John Kerry, the Dan Rather of 2006, this year's election is about Iraq.

From Kerry's GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich, to Howard Dean to a San Francisco (where Nancy Pelosi is from) supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military, the antipathy is indelible.

If this has happened once, chances are it's happened before right? It would indeed be interesting have a look at the previous appearances of Volunteer Marek at AE, and see if he got off without sanction as a result of deceptive shit going on in the background. I know of one occasion it did; on that occasion Piotrus went running to Newyorkbrad and wikilawyered his EMML buddy out of yet another block. It is for that reason, upon seeing that occur, and my block being left intact, that I sent Arbcom a number of emails to ask them what the fuck they were doing. Would anyone like to have a look at other instance, and see if that held true, and who the AE closing admin was. I know the AE from last year didn't see any possibility of Piotrus getting VM out of the shit; but instead, several days into VM's massive two week block (don't worry VM, it will be an indefinite block for you soon enough), Piotrus goes and awards VM a purple heart barnstar; the purple heart of course being awarded to those injured in battle; what a nice fitting tribute to the battleground that is Volunteer Marek's talk page  it's still displayed there.

 Final Edit 

Since I'll never be editing Wikipedia again, I thought I'd add a few notes here for the benefit of the few people involved who aren't delusional.  One day, I logged on to discover that I had been accused of being someone else and was facing being banned as a result.  When I objected, instead of being banned for being someone else, I was banned for objecting.  The person who did the banning had been carrying a grudge for literally years, having been caught trying to ban me for similar ludicrously and transparently self-serving reasons years earlier, only to have his malicious action overturned.  In the years since he had been initially caught, the administrators who had cared one way or the other slowly dropped away as Wikipedia slid into its own navel.  A larger and larger proportion of Wikipedia's dwindling contributions are being directed towards bureaucracy and petty politics.  This is always the sign of a community rapid decline.  I do not anticipate that Wikipedia will be relevant for much longer, though it may linger for decades as an increasingly toxic MMORPG for authoritarian sperglords.

The proof that this ban has nothing to do with my contributions and everything to do with my legitimate criticism of Wikipedia is that my user page (containing criticism of the systemic biases within Wikipedia and the noxious atmosphere within its community  which had already survived one attempt at censorship through official channels) was gleefully blanked once I no longer had the power to fix it, complete with mocking """"buh-bye"""" commentary.

Eric Hoffer wrote, """"You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you.""""  I never cared about Wikipedia; I came here because a blatantly libellous biography about me had sat untouched for months and only when it was corrected to make it factually correct, only then action was taken to have it removed on the basis of being a """"non-notable"""" and a """"vanity"""" article.  In the years since that initial experience, nothing I've experienced has done anything to contradict my distaste with the bullying, authoritarian culture within Wikipedia, and serves to confirm my suspicions about the sort of society Randroids like Jimbo would like to foist on us.  It is, however, telling that the worst punishment Wikipedia's brownshirt enforcers can think to enforce upon me is to prevent me from contributing to their project.  If I was a troll and an agent provocateur, clearly I wouldn't care and, in any case, could easily create more accounts.  I know several people who do just that.  It's obvious that the people who want so desperately to silence me and my unthinkable criticism of the wildly dysfunctional culture within Wikipedia don't really think I'm a troll or a sock puppeteer or whatever other excuses they've dragged up for silencing me; it's that I infuriatingly refuse to consider it some kind of glorious reward to give free labour to Wikipedia.

It's an odd situation, to be forcefully barred from rowing the oars on a sinking ship, for the apparently inexcusable crime of noting that the ship is sinking.  Even now, I suspect that this final commentary will be removed, because the presence of discordant voices inside the echo chamber of Wikipedia is intolerable, even when those voices are trying to draw attention to a problem which will ultimately destroy the very community which is providing the milieu in which the echo chamber ostensibly exists to protect.  Some of the people involved clearly have a long and well-documented history of cognitive distortions which leave them largely unable to either control or be held morally culpable for their actions.  It's not these people, the sadly delusional acolytes of Jimbo, to whom I address this, but the few remaining people within Wikipedia who have closed their eyes to what's occuring.  I don't have any desire to be re-chained to the oars, so this isn't about shaming anyone into overturning the decision of the kangaroo court which silenced me on Wikipedia.  This is about getting the more-or-less sane people to feel some sense of personal responsibility for refusing to either make the attempt to stand up to the bullies or remove themselves from the culture which fosters and supports the bullies.

 Understanding how to write Wikipedia articles 

You are obviously a single-purpose account, contributing only to Ashwant Dwivedi. The chances are high that either you are that person, you are related to him or you know him personally. In any event, you are pretty consistently making a mess of things at the article and I'm struggling to clean up the problems that you create. It's not a vendetta against you as a person, though.

There is little doubt in my mind that you would benefit from contributing to a wider range of articles in order to gain exposure to how we actually write things here. There is, for example, no rationale for including every news story that you can find about a person - especially not when they are trivial soundbites or repetitive information - nor is there any need to misrepresent sources by saying he is a """"Pacific Islands Diplomat"""" when, at best, he was a Fijian one. Things like this would be more obvious to you if you were not so constrained by your self-imposed concentration on one article. They would also be more obvious if you actually tried discussing things with other people and listening to what they say. I'm not always right but I am pretty experienced here and, as with anything in life, one key way to learn is to pick up things from those who have done it before.

I'm absolutely fed up with you at the moment, having given you a massive amount of rope over many months. But I'm quite happy to let bygones by bygones if only you can actually demonstrate a willingness to develop your skills here. The article will, in my opinion, be deleted anyway but there is much else here that you could work on in the future if you are prepared to spend a bit of time understanding how Wikipedia works. I rather suspect that we could use more decent contributors for Fiji-related subjects, for example. -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Origin 
The evidence presented by the following paragraph does not convince me of the relation between the Orkhon script and the Rovás. I've heard that conclusion elsewhere, and I'm not necessarily doubting it, but I just don't see proof from the arguments made here:
""""Around 600 AD, the yet illiterate Hungarian tribes moved southwest from their earlier territories to the coastal region of the Eastern Black Sea. The Hungarian Runes are almost certainly related to the Orkhon or Turkic Runic script. 

Says who? 

""""This is supported by the Hungarian tribes' early geography propinquity [Is this supposed to be """"proximity?""""] to the Göktürks.""""

So what? At various times in history they were near Germanic, Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic, and maybe Greek peoples. It doesn't follow, from the evidence presented that the Turkic influence was the source of the writing.

""""Moreover, thirteen of the Hungarian rovás glyphs closely resemble characters of the Orkhon script.

Which ones? I don't count 13 convergences. I see a lot of resemblance in overall appearance between Futhark and Rovás; they seem to show a greater resemblance to each other than with Orkhon. Some prominent features of the Orkhon script are absent in Rovás, e.g. reduplicated characters, and the use of dots or other small characters detached from the main sign.

I'm not arguing that German Runes and Rovás are necessarily closely related; it's just that the evidence presented by this section of this article is hardly convincing. If someone can correct this, please do.  !""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Do not dismiss users with longer experience with the case as it was based on this experience that the talk page was brought out. For instance, I received mails from the person who wrote the biography of the affair both for the french and the english talk page, as those din't knew enough about the matter to start with.
If I were you, I will feel suspicious of receiving approuval and encouragemets about what you are doing, from a person who first heard about this affair for 3 weeks ago, second: heard about it from ybm -the drive force of this affair and person who resurected it from ashes in nov. 2003 - so not much reliable as an eye opener and arbitrary source of informations, and third: who has conducted, since then, a revert war in the best anti-3RR rules, and best ybm styles...

It isn't right for an admi to emit subjectiv and judgementals accusations toward users, as calling them socket puppet and other insulting terminology, as it is usually to be found in the mouth of the persons who in shortage of argumentation, choose to attack people personnaly in best sophistics style.
So no surprise that the person who rever you is the same one who used that language constantly against other users before you stepped in, and who was also doing the reverting job as you are doing it now.

It is abusively unclear, what you are trying to do, and I do hope that a more adequate person will take over the surveillance of this talk page. One with the right degree of integrity, the proper knowledge of the stuff, here physic, a thourough insight in the affair and its history, and a knowledge of the people involved and their characters and profile in regard to the topic.
I think here of Nicholas Turnbull, administrator, and expert in mediation.

I have, unfortunately, to aknowledge the fact that your latest actions have resulted in creating a turmoil on the site, based both on your actions and your utterings, and that you have provocated 50% of the users, who had already been harshly provocated by user r-b-j for several weeks and needed therefor the administrators help to put an end to it, not to overtake the place of the source of turmoils.

I do believe that you are acting your best with your actual knowledge of the facts, but nonetheless you should be more carefull to don't bruise som ego by commiting unfully justified and unjust actions in the process, and as a consequence endanger the quality of the talk page.

As those arguments for and against have been dancing in parallel for far too long time, without everreaching a solid ground of agreement, and as references made by anti bogdanov are always pointed at some unclear statement made by scientifics a long time ago, where most did redraw it, and as all those people of science didn't knew a thing about Theoretical Physic and/or Cosmologie, which this dispute is about, and as the positiv statements, made by specialists in the fields named above, are systematically unaccepted for tricky reasons, as are the statements made on this page by pro-bogdanovian, who are called socket puppets for a yes or for a no, I suggest this affair to be settled once and for all by truly and undiscustably specialists in that field, I named Holger Beck Nielsen professor of the Copenhague Niels Bohr Institut of Theoretical Physic, and Stephen W. Hawking, from the Chair of Mathematic of Cambridge University.

I have already made the necessary steps in order to bring professor Holger Beck Nielsen attention to that matter, and would like to know if anyone feel of doing the same in England.
I tried already to suggest this approach above, but it seems that my suggestion was drawned in the tumults of the fights and remained ignored.
I will ask you to make a join effort to gather your attention on this particular possibility and think of how each of you can take part in its fullfillment, in the best interest of all parts involved.

I heard that Cantonese music differs from Mandarin in that Mandarin respects the language tones in the melody, but Cantonese doesn't. Is it true?
 

 Good Cantopops do respect the language tones in the melody, as all Chinese dialects are tone-sensitive. What you heard is a recent disaster in HK music, beautiful face is more important than singing skills and so songs become less important.  But there are still many real musicians care about the tones and the melody. 

Cantonese is more tonal than Mandarin.  Mandarin only has 4 tones for each pronunciation, but Cantonese has at least 6 tones according to most dictionaries.  Some author even claims there are 9 tones in Cantonese.  Even though written Chinese can be pronunced in Cantonese or Mandarin, but the sound differs so much that you cannot sing a Cantonese song in Mardarin nor vice versa.  Many popular tunes get both Cantonese and Mandarin lyrics which are totally rewritten and sometimes with unrelated subjects.   20:31, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Yes but Mandarin has a more pleasant rhythm when spoken with natural darkness and light and this translates into songs pleasnter on the ear.I've heard people talk about Cantonese as sounding like a machine gun on the ear. 

And, how do Cantopop artists deal with music piracy? 
 

 Cantopop artists deal with piracy using the same technique as European or American artists, i.e. virtually nothing they can do!!! 

 But I was under the impression that in HK and Canton, media piracy was much much higher than in Europe or America. But there still are Cantopop artists. Are the economic models different? Do they resort to corporate patronage? ...  

 Curious: How did you hear that """"height"""" in Cantonese areas?  00:40 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 I meant South China in general, but it should affect Cantopop. My source is Slashdot . Ehem. I think I read something in Wired of Bruce Sterling finding dirt-cheap pirated media there, but I don't find it. I though tit was common knowledge.  

You have some of the most popular cantopop stars e.g. Joey Yung and Twins going on TV and saying how poor they are and asking their fans not to steal their livlihoods.And yes they do resort to corporate patronage of a sort.In the Joey Yung interview I was referring to, she claimed that she was making no money on her albums, but that she still had to produce albums to keep herself in the public eye and maintain her fanbase. With a large enough fanbase she can make money on personal appearances and concerts.For example Jade Kwan has recently been booked by a chain of bars, in the mainland, for a dozen or so 20 minute mini-concerts.Furthermore if you are popular enough you can make money through endorsments.There isn't a single reasonably attractive female cantopop singer who isn't e",0,0,0,0,0,0

First, NPOV is only violated by you. Why do you say """"of course"""" (as EU brings nothing good) and if you look e.g. to England or Poland, most parties are Anti-EU (which does not mean, they want immediately a withdrawal), and that's """"of course"""". It are simply facts. Most parties in Europe are Anti-EU, but even if not, why would that be a reason not to mention the parties who speculate about withdrawal?? And why would non-winning in elections be a reason not to mention them?? They seek EU Withdrawal or a major reform or opt-outs for their nations. But as you say, you don't want they have weight, because you simply do not tolerate other opinions about the EU and wanna have your LibDem-Pro-EU-Opinion (which is anyway evil) in the article and undermine the parties who want real freedom and independence (though in fact, we Anti-EUists do not have opinions, but knowledge). Second, all that would give WP a very bad name, which you don't wanna, though it has anyway a bad name yet as WP is a non-neutral center-left pro-EUSA propaganda platform.

Re the definition of what is obsolete, that is simple. Every concept is built based on some data. When new data have been obtained, the concept must either accommodate these data or explain why these data can be ignored. The concept that fail to do so is deemed obsolete.

However, after discovery of the red shift by Hubble it became obvious that this theory is inconsistent with these data. Now this theory is believed to be obsolete.

Excellent. And please don't damage your book on our account, for sure. It is an interesting question: Where was the camera? That's a fair question.

The picture is useful for another reason, as it shows a similar relative position of the LEM and the antenna for this Apollo 14 flight as on that web page that argues about those objects in Apollo 12. In both cases, the antenna is at a 45 degree angle away from the LEM, and both the near photo and the distant photo on that website are consistent with each other, despite the website's claims to the contrary.

Civility, not me, but him and how about you

I saw ur message on my user talk page.

I hope you posted the same message to the other guy too.
If you didnt, you are quite wrong and not impartial.
Did you even read his message to me on my user page to which I replied on his user page (the reply on my own user talk page is a little different), and for which u messaged me?
Please do that and you will learn, I replied to him, point by point, using his very words!
How can that be uncivil then???

Keeping with your message, I only replied to him point by point, in his own medicine, nor did I make any personal attacks in the message i left on his user page nor did i make any disruptions on any wiki articles. Thats just wrong on ur part. 

Further his comments werent against me, they were against good sense!
His attempted criticism was totally wrong and unjustified.
He just wanted to have his vain last word in.
When his """"superior"""" final views failed, I guess he must have complained to you.
Further, I think that guy is obsessed in seeing his name on the top of the history page of the article in question. Seriously, does he think people care? What a pathetic loser! lol.

If you read my user page, you will notice an admin(i guess) Sue-Anne really appreciated my same, if i say so myself, pretty good edits to which this vain Vesther guy had obvious problems with """"without any basis"""", obviously because someone other than him had made them.
Even after my final crisp edits to the article, after which I never even read it, this guy kept trying hard to somehow """"condense"""" it even more as he kept informing me in his messages! I guess more than 1 letter is too big for him!! And somehow funnily this guy keeps repeating about the leadership issue as the the reason for the firing, when I myself had mentioned it earlier as the primary reason for firing. So whats he saying and to whom? Is this guy dense or what? Thats just too stupid & funny. His density, lol, is most amazing!!! If that guy cant stand people editing articles in a good manner (in a manner for which people actually complimented me), what is this guy doing on wiki? Does he own the articles? lol. Assuming good intention is one thing but how can one not respond to the stupid things he keeps posting on my user page???!!! And when his stupid attempted criticisms are given back to him in his own medicine, he suddenly starts crying??
I pity the poor guy.

Further I see he wrote on the message board that he appreciates my inputs in certain areas of the WEBSITE.
Now, the small section of the article in question, which I had contributed to, itself is only a few lines. He has to decide whether he is appreciative of my lines in that section or not, he never let me know his appreciation! lol. And he further keeps trying to condense those few lines. Just Look how many times he is trying to obsessively change those """"very few lines"""" and the very small section now. And all these months he was sleeping before I contributed my inputs into that section? Amazing!!
That guys got serious issues.
MAN.
LOL.

I know, you may find this a little strong right now, but really you too would have been exasperated by this guys """"denseness"""" by now. LOL.
This guy just wouldnt listen to good sense. Theres no point in arguing with such a fool.

Anyway, I expect you to post the Civility message you posted on my page, on his page, unless you are unfair.

I am tempted to write a message to him saying """"Hey, stupid, how can people accept your stupid dumb utterly wrong criticisms and how can people not respond to ur dumb comments when u leave them on other's user pages!""""

But, now, THAT would be uncivil, so I wont!!!

Anyway, this is all quite silly and irrelevant and a waste of time (this message itself is too lengthy!!). I expect NOT to hear from u about this further on my user page though I will check if u posted a message to him, to confirm your impartiality either which way.

Also, I hope you remove your civility message from my user page, because i dont think its correct or impartial.

Also because I use my account now instead of the IP.

Bye bye.

Anyway this is all quite extraneous and silly. Lets get on with the real purpose of bettering wiki articles and of course being civil on the way!!

Rascals became superstars with rockstar status. Listening to their

on time. They were the first editors I remember playing with speed
(slowing down voices/phrases) They seemed to be on everything from
radio(ktu,kiss fm and hot 103.5 and hot 97.1) club music to hip hop
(king kut; Run Dmc King of Rock) and pop. They produced many hits in
the club/freestyle genre; appeared on movie soundtracks
(disorderlies) and appeared on television (the music show second
generation with andy panda and tony moran) produced a hip hop
platinum album (the fat boys) became succesful artists (bach to the
future; arabian nights) and world reknowned remixers. Out of the
pack (omar santana; carlos berrios, chep nunez, etc...) these guys
did it all. Albert Cabrera appeared on Ktu solo and what he
accomplished with a pause button was nothing short of amazing. I'm
still in shock at some of the things I heard done; this coupled with
the ability to do megamix medleys seperated him from the bunch; when
he paired with tony moran things got crazier. The remixes they did

I would recommend trying to limit your list to some
(likely) forgotten names in strictly the tape cutting trade,
or very prominently focussing on cutting up masters,
because the ones we know, like Cabrera, Berrios etc.
well, everyone can mention those...

Also, not all DJ's do impressive cutting.
If we're gonna mention each and every person
who has cut tape once, where do you draw the line?

Remarkable is that this 12 inch does not even credit them
anywhere, even though everybody knew, if only from their
peculiar dark 'sound', that Cabrera and Moran had touched it ;-)

Yes, but it might have been 1982 when Jellybean and Baker
tried out their first versions of 'Confusion' in the Funhouse club.
It usually took quite some time back then, for the world to hear
those tracks, or have them available as a release on vinyl.

Also interesting;
http://www.record-producers.com/roster/arthurbaker/biography.html

And I found:

[Jonathan Scott] """"In early 1984 I spoke to a member of New Orders sound crew
who mentioned a Confusion mix he 'had heard' that was basically an unreleased
Arthur Baker/Jellybean project mixing the basic elements of 'Confusion'
with parts of Freeze's 'IOU'. [...] I have been told that it surfaced
on a dub-plate (acetate) and was produced in a New York cutting house.""""

Reportedly, a mix of Confusion/IOU used to be played a lot at the Hacienda around 1984/85.

 South China Institute of Technology 

Hello again
[Written before the block. Posting it anyway.] Hi Liuyg (or ). I have seen the Leiden ranking website. I did electronic searches for """"South"""" and """"China"""" but did not find South China University of Technology at all, so the page does not your claim that Leiden ranks SCUT as """"4th in China"""". If I made a mistake, just let me know what rank SCUT appears at, and I will add the information to the article myself.

Pages on universities have to present independently confirmed information on universities. Vague promotional language like """"world class"""" and """"top ranking"""" is not good enough. Also, you added no source to support your claim that SCUT was founded in 1924 and not in 1952. (Sun Yat-sen University was founded in 1924.) Besides, the long list of rankings is not proper Wikipedia format (see WP:UNIV): you should just name SCUT's rank and add the reference. Finally, your large edit is often made of incomplete sentences, and it removed a lot of useful wikilinks. You added too much flawed material at the same time, so I had to revert.

Some of the information you want to add might be valuable. Other editors, including myself, will help you if you add a small amount of material each time, or if you discuss your additions on the talk page. Wikipedia is based on discussion and consensus, so please stop adding this badly formatted, badly written, and badly referenced material all at the same time!

 Your edit on National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma 

I hate to bring this up, but I don't care if the content you removed from National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma was relevant or not; the edit summary you left was, in my opinion, inaccurate, and, more importantly, was really insulting to me. You shouldn't just remove everything that makes the office unique; how's it different from every other office then? Undoubtedly, some of that information was in fact irrelevant or excessive, but instead of actually doing anything to help the article, you have done nothing more than strip it down. I know that you have made some great contributions to the wiki, but that edit summary was kind of like a slap to the face. If the content you removed was entirely non-unique and useless, then your edit summary might have been a bit more justified, but that was most certainly not the case. I'm not going to call you lazy or insult you (I don't think you're lazy, that's not what I am implying), but I am going to say that you could have done better. I've dealt with enough of this sort of gesture. Through all of this, I am trying to remain as civil as possible, but if you are going to say that you don't like the article as is, make more of it than simply stripping it down. There are other areas of the office's history which I would far rather expand upon, but I would likely be heavily restricted in terms of finding non-primary sources. I hate WP:PRIMARY enough; that's one of the reasons I been dealing with many problems from some editors. That's part of what forced me to userfy the page, which in turn is part of the reason for which next to no editors aside from myself have edited the article. No one wants to edits a user space draft apart from the relevant user. That's why I have received little input on the article. In any case, please just be kinder in the future; I intend no offense here, and I will admit that there were and are problems with the article, but please do not just go around removing cited content without also helping to build as well. Please don't take any offense or think me """"foolish"""" or something (I don't know what you will think when you read this) like some editors would.

Turkey and the other states are not European states. Geographically Turkey, Kazakstan, Aserbeidshan, Armenia, Georgia and Cyprus are Asian nations.

 DRN needs assistance 

You are receiving this message because you have listed yourself as a volunteer at the Dispute Resolution Noticeboard.

We have a backlog of cases there which need volunteer attention. If you have time available, please take one or more of these cases.

If you do not intend to take cases or help with the administration of DRN on a regular basis, or if you do not wish to receive further notices of this nature, please remove your username from the volunteer list. If you later decide to resume activities at DRN you may relist your name at that time.

Best regards, TransporterMan  (current DRN coordinator)

Thank you Thank you for your message on Alessandro57's talk page. I am frustated myself that this editor has stacked administrators and others in his favor. No one person can contribute without instantly being unedited. He will not even discuss a compromise or negotiate. Thanks again for expressing exactly how I feel. - Cpetty9979   

 Hello there, Cpetty9979. Thank you for your kind words. I wouldn't waste my time with the likes of Alessandro57 if I were you, as you'd most likely get blocked by the admins in an unfair manner while he'd get off scot-free. Such is the absurdity of this pseudo-encyclopedia, whose admins are more interested in gaming the system than in making academic contributions to the articles.   

 Yemen casualties 

Your point that Saudi sources tend to undercount their casualties is well taken. However, there's not a lot we can do about that, as we need to go off of reliable sources per WP:V.  on the Talk page rather than edit-warring, which won't get you what you want. -  

Please discuss the issue on the talk page of that article. Thanks.   

I inserted some compromise wording in the infobox about attributing the figures to a specific source. However, I would again ask that you do not reinsert (as you did without an explanation) casualty incidents which have nothing to do with the Saudi-led campaign. Stick only to incidents linked to the military intervention, not to the overall war in general.

9f18317ecafc6298,"Hazel Eye Myth==

The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. 

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.

As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown.

Here are some examples of what true hazel eyes are;

Hazel Eye Picture On The Right

The picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes, as it is blue with central heterochromia (brown around the pupil). The hazel eye description says nothing about hazel eyes being blue in any way, so i trust this is a mistake that needs to be changed immediately, i propose one of the following pictures be shown in it's place as they match a golden light brown hazelnut colour:

well i'm a malaysian guy and i have to say what i really see, if we look to The total length of the Gulf coast about 3300 meters, the share of Iran which has about one third only and the rest belongs to arab countries, also if we will look to the side of Iran we will find them arab people persianized but originally they are an arab people who want to get out of the iranian government and make their own arabic country. more over look to the Roman & Ottman Epires and u will not find the name """"persian"""" also because i understand arabic i checked in this site what is written in arabic then i found the map was using the term """"Sein Arabique"""" then i wish that my arab friend get the name because in the time while the persian empire was strong they change that name while they was in golden age it doesnt give them the right to make it standred name.

 No Referance for the Sheikh Saeed House's Map, what do you think? 

 false allegations 
False alleations and fake maps have been answered [].   
 Please don't delete information, maps, documents and historical citing from ancient historian without cosulting other editors of this page ahead. This is organized vandalizing! You mentioned a website that is Iranian and represent Iran's POV and cannot be neutral or reliable to judge a """"fake map""""!!!. Wikipedia and not affiliated to the Iranian government and doesn't represent one-side of ideology. This page is semi-protected not to be destroyed or vandalized by IP address users. As editors here, you should not praise such behavior and immediately revert the page to its last preview. Radical changes to refelect one-POV is not accepted. This behavior is going to be reported to Wikipedia adminstrators. Please consider helping instead of damaging or orienting. Ralhazzaa 

The maps you have presented aren't anything new Ralhazaa. I can't believe people keep having the same discussions in this talk page over and over again. and everytime the discussions reach the same conclusion, but then after a couple of weeks another person starts the same pointless round of edits. To be very brief (these have been discussed in length in different sections of the talk page and it's archives):  1. The maps you mentioned were proven to be inaccurate and were corrected in their later versions. verified through several articles and sources.  2. The UN resolution you mentioned does not pertain to """"international"""" bodies of water, but to bodies of water that are shared between two or more countries. There is a difference. For example Shat-al-Arab is a river which falls under that category. But international waters do not fall under that category and the UN geographical names committee approves the standard  international name for them.  

 To ralhazza.  First of all we have discussed all issues here.  There does not exist a single textual evidence for Arabian Gulf.  We have about 300+ maps and 8 maps you brought from different books all have maps of Persian Gulf and their newer edition have been corrected.  It is all there and you can not insert a POV without discussion.  Read it again: [].  Why aren't you bringing newer maps from the newer editions of those books and mentioning that texts calls it Persian Gulf?   

 Perfect truth is not attainable like this. Show all POVs boys! 

Hi all,

In this page, ancient referential maps, citations from historical books, UN resolutions and policies is going to be added in brief to balance and neutralize this page, as many users wanted through this talk, considering the policies of editing on Wikipedia. Evaluating “Undue weight” cannot not to be decided only by small group of users, logically. These maps are going to show different side of information and represent different POV (not just by Arabs). Medieval maps, classical history references, UN organization reports related to solving dispute in geographical naming should show both POV for giving more neutrality in this page. Other users are required not to violate the using of references by saying """"It is incorrect!"""" or """"False"""" as long as it is apparently Ancient, Referential, Internationally Accepted and Used, Showing different POV(s) and Neutral.

One of the most fundamental groups (sometimes referred to as being part of the """"Plymouth Brethren"""" or the """"Exclusive Brethren"""" although we much prefer something along the lines of, say, """"Christians"""") refers to their buildings as Gospel Halls.

Again, I was combating the notion that it was a """"absurd part"""" to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. Since many researchers hold this position, it would be unfair to call it absurd. The disorder part is divided in the field, some argue that it is not a disorder at all, some do. At the end of the day, it is a value judgment (as Cantor pointed out earlier in the thread), not a scientific judgement. If we choose to make this value judgment in the article, it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same.

AGF?  You basically told me to buzz off when I asked you about it.  AGF is NOT an excuse to just shove crap into the encyclopedia.  Why, just because you are part of some organized event to do something do think that means you should get a pass on doing it right?  You could have said something like, """"Good Idea mate.  I'll remember that in the future.""""  and added the damn name of the city into the article. That would have been AGF on your part.  But instead you give some flimsy excuse that you are participating in some project as a reason not to do it right.  That is not AGF.

I have no idea what state Freemantle is in, or i would have done it myself.  It would have taken you less time to add the reference to the article than it did to put it in the Afd, which, by the way, you still haven't done.  Once it is notable, I will be happy to withdraw the AfD. Your article did not meet notability.  You had the info at hand to get it there, but rather than putting it in the article, you are instead arguing about it at AfD.  Is it your expectation that someone should come along and clean up after you?  If you don't have a complete article, draft it in userspace until you do.  BTW, you are the only one showing an attitude of OWN.  I haven't even edited on the article, how could I be showing OWN?  The ONLY reason to edit on Wikipedia is to improve the encyclopedia, not to create some benefit to a local organization.  My gripe in general is probably not with you, but with the event's organizer.  However, you certainly could have responded in a more productive way.  I will repeat, if the project you are involved in is not telling you that the reason to create articles in Wikipedia is to improve the encyclopedia, they are doing you a disservice.  Your article was, and is, not meeting WP:GNG.  It was probably not the best idea on my part to nominate it at Afd, but what is done is done.  Fix it and I will be happy to withdraw it.

 Proposed wording on the """"generalities"""" of autoformatting 

Since the key members of the pro-autoformatting side—UC Bill and Locke Cole—have conceded that the results of the previous RfC on “son of autoformatting” would likely repeat itself if we conducted an ArbCom-sponsored RfC (∆ here), where Locke wrote , I am tempted to ask that you, Ryan, issue a declaratory judgement due to their default. I can’t help but suspect that they knew all along that the previous RfC was a fair measure of the true community consensus when Locke dragged us all to this ArbCom. However…

I instead propose that we do as Locke proposes: present autformatting to the community in a more generalized manner, not attached to any specific implementation such as UC Bill’s “son of autoformatting” as described above.

Here is what I would propose:

Since this seems to have blown up spectacularly in my face, I might as well explain my edit. /

I came across this BLP, which hadn't been edited since last year, and noticed that the paragraph about her signing that creationism petition seemed a disjointed and tangential - her signing the petition is unquestionably notable, but it seemed jarring to go straight from discussion of her research to """"In February 2006, the New York Times reported... The petition, a two-sentence statement,"""" without stating why she signed the petition or anything. We have an essay about these sorts of articles and the problems with them - WP:COATRACK. I checked out her personal webpage, noticed she was quite open about her religion, googled """"Rosalind Picard christian"""" and found an Atlantic Monthly article that discussed at length why she was a creationist. So I added a sentence about that, making the article flow more smoothly into the signing of the petition. I also removed the second sentence explaining the petition, as I thought it was straying too off-topic.

I discussed this with Raul and can now see the merits of leaving that last sentence in - I think the article as it now stands is acceptable. What's greatly troubling to me is that instead of discussing this and working out a compromise, certain folks refused my invitation to discuss it and instantly jumped on me and started canvassing for a revert war when a few minutes of discussion would have cheerfully resolved the situation instead. (I'm personally as agnostic and anti-creationist as it gets... the only god I'm working in the name of here is WP:BLP.)

bf67d219f255586d,"Regarding workstations, servers and mainframes 

I believe that workstations and servers are classes of computers, not sizes.

For example, consider the IBM Power 595. It is a server, is it not? From the page, IBM seems to think so, and it certainly fits the definition of a server, with that being a computer that provides a service(s) to client(s). Now, consider the IBM Power 520. This too is a server, is it  not? IBM thinks so, and it fits the definition.

However, the Power 595 is not a desktop. It is nowhere near a desktop. It is a rackmount (IBM-speak: framemount) server, as evidenced by its dimensions: (201.4 cm x 77.5 cm x 180.6 cm); and weight: (1,552 kg). I will personally give anyone who can fit this on an average office desk from Ikea, a cookie.

Now, the Power 520 is not a rackmount server. It is nowhere near a rackmount server. It is a deskside server, as evidenced by its dimensions: (540 mm x 182-328 mm x 628 mm); and weight: (40.8 kg). I will personally give anyone who can convince a Fortune 500 company that the Power 520 is a top-of-the-line rackmount server, a cookie.

Two very different machines, both in hardware and form factor, but they are still both classed as a server. Clearly, as evidenced by this, servers can be in many form factors. A server can be a desktop, but it is not exclusively a desktop. How the article is currently written seems to suggest that it is. A server can also be a rackmount, a tower, a blade, a deskside and a pedestal, to name a few.

Workstations also come in more form factors than just desktop. Many servers are desktops (as in horizontal) and are small and light enough to be placed on a desk (the second, more historical definition of a desktop). However, they can also be in a deskside, tower, rackmountable or pedestal form factor, just to name a few.

This can be remedied by not using classes to determine size. Instead, use form factors such as blade, rackmount, deskside, etc.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 A quesiton about material allowed on userpages 

here you said,  """"The userpage, or userspace, is not to be used to house a list of misdeeds of another user, unless it is going to be used in dispute resolution, such as RfC.""""

An aside, before I ask my question, I tried to provide dispute resolution in that incident, but my involvement was based upon my assumption that Drolz was concerned about being blocked, and wanted to assemble evidence should that occur. Turns out my fears  were right, he was blocked, but he wasn't amassing Vir quotes for that reason, so I dropped out of the discussion.

I can understand why WP would want to discourage collections of misdeeds, but I can also understand why prohibiting it might equally be a problem. I haven't reached my own conclusions on what the policy should be.

Back to my question (after pointing out that I am familiar with WP:OSE)—do you think  is compliant with or a violation of the policy statement you made?

I'm not about to waste my time proposing it for MfD, but I am interested in whether you can distinguish that page from the page of Drolz, which you felt should be deleted.T """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 User:Slrubenstein and other's falsifying and defamatory edits 

User:Slrubenstein who obviously does not like the word 'theory' (and didn't like the article from the beginning) has repeatedly edited the article adding falsifying terms like 'proposal' instead. Nowhere does Carotta """"propose"""" or """"claim"""" anything. Already in the Introit of his book Jesus was Caesar it is clearly stated that: To anticipate the result: Jesus proves to be Divus Iulius, the deified Caesar, passed down in tradition. The word he uses for this finding is 'disclosure'. So it is wrong to write he 'proposes' or 'claims'. 'Theory' was therefore the best compromise, but the respectable User:Slrubenstein and other distorters don't like that. It should be noted here that User:Slrubenstein has not bothered to explain and discuss on this talk page why he egomaniacally altered the status quo and threatened other users who maintained 'theory' with blockage which was later carried out. He has not answered the questions raised by someone above concerning his problems with this article either.

Now this excellent User:Slrubenstein has even gone so far as to """"protect"""" (i.e. block, prevent editing) the article altogether. I think everyone involved in this or just reading here should seriously ask themselves whether User:Slrubenstein who canvassed against the article, voted for stong delete and most emphatically defamed the author as """"crackpot"""" (this might be actionable), is the right person to further work on this article let alone be an admin in control of it.

User:Rbreen who also voted for strong delete and who has already been convicted of lying and destorting scholarly statements above, now thinks he is the appropriate authority to judge on Carotta's undeniable and never before denied classical scholarship. He obviously knows better than reputable scholars like Piñero, Canfora, Kavoukopoulos, Simon and others. Here's your typical Wikipedia editor.

Nothing new can be said of User:Iblardi either. He helps wherever he can to degrade the article and defame its subject.

User:EALacey is not even capable (or is he not willing?) to correctly translate the word """"Wissenschaftsparodie"""" into English. The correct translation is """"science parody"""". Another typical WP editor, it seems.

I don't even want to talk about User:carl.bunderson. Some quotes from the Gospel come to mind...

Designed and constructed in the mid-century modern style of the period, the Green Fairway Estates tract is perched on the edge of Tahquitz Golf Course in the southern part of the city. The fairway homes begin near the corner of Lakeside Drive and Brentwood and snake their way down the street continuing on to a portion of Pebble Beach. Each home was built according one of nine master floor plans, each theme being repeated only two or three times due to the limited number of homes that were constructed prior to 1965  the year that the Alexanders died in a plane crash. Fortunately for the development, however, a number of Green Fairway Estates were completed prior to or soon after this terrible accident.

The Green Fairway Estates are in many ways the """"Brigadoon"""" Alexanders of Palm Springs, as very few people  even die-hard modernists  know about the neighborhood. Many of the Green Fairway homes are executed in an Asiatic or South Pacific style, influenced no doubt by the sense of Eastern exoticism being brought home by World War II soldiers. Construction features include A-frame roofs, lava rock facades, Aztec motifs, and other """"exotic"""" features. With floorplan names like The Royal Singapore and The Maracaibo, the whimsical ideals and themes of the period are in full force. 

The architect responsible for these models was architect Donald Wexler  architect of the Palm Springs International Airport and the now famous North End steel homes. The area surrounding the tract was originally surveyed and developed by the Westview Development Company in 1958. Westview Development Corporation was operated by Chicago residential and commercial developer Morton Zuckerman (president) and vice-president Frank Bogert, mayor of Palm Springs. In charge of sales was realtor and developer George Gannon. The designer of the golf course was Lawrence Huges.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Re:ANI question 

Hey Bugs, just as a follow up to this question, there are no Malware in the program. As I answered about the registry cleaner, some people don't understand how much damage """"cleaning"""" your registry can do. Not that I've never done it, but I tend to manually remove items these days because I don't trust any """"cleaners"""". In any case, it's the 3rd party software that most complaints are coming from. And although those are not Malware either, some of the programs do trigger Avast and some other anti-virus software, but as Adware or potentially unwanted programs. These are installed if you aren't reading the installation and just click """"Next, Next, Next\ etc.. You have the """"Decline"""" option, but they don't make it very clear. It's disappointing that CNet now allows this, but it's all about $$$. And they can just say there are options to decline. Which there are. You can delete this whenever, I just didn't want to clutter ANI up with the expansion of this gibberish. heh   

 Main Page appearance: Babe Ruth 

This is a note to let the main editors of Babe Ruth know that the article will be appearing as today's featured article on July 11, 2014. If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. If you prefer that the article appear as TFA on a different date, or not at present, please ask . You can view the TFA blurb at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/July 11, 2014. If it needs tweaking, or if it needs rewording to match improvements to the article between now and its main page appearance, please edit it, following the instructions at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/instructions. The blurb as it stands now is below:

Babe Ruth (1895–1948) was an American baseball outfielder and pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1914 to 1935. Born in Baltimore, Ruth was sent at age seven to St. Mary's, a reformatory where he learned baseball skills. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles. He began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including 714 career home runs. In his fifteen years with the Yankees, Ruth helped them win seven American League pennants and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that boosted baseball's popularity and made home runs a major factor in the sport. Ruth's unprecedented power and carousing lifestyle made him a larger-than-life figure in the """"Roaring Twenties"""". One of the first five inductees into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture, and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. 

You (and your talk-page stalkers) may also be interested to hear that there have been some changes at the TFA requests page recently.  Nominators no longer need to calculate how many """"points"""" an article has, the instructions have been simplified, and there's a new nomination system using templates based on those used for DYK suggestions. Please consider nominating another article, or commenting on an existing nomination, and leaving some feedback on your experience. Thank you.

The bottom line is this; Nobody has complained except   and one other individual, a little truce with him and he had no problem. Including information in collapsible boxes does make the page look neater. I have not gone to the pages that I put collapsible boxes on and counted, but it literally is over a million hits collectively. Nobody has complained. Using blindness and repetivive stress injury, as reasons not to include collapsible tables is a specious argument at best. Collapsible boxes in some instances are the best way to present information without cluttering the page. 
As to the superfluous images, again the opinion of one individual. The article is a general article on eating disorders. Including images of obese individuals or the ravages that having an eating disorder can have on a person serve no purpose. If the same priciples are applied across the board the article on obesity had a number of superfluous images, including the one of an overweight child on a school playground. Someone already commented on the use of that image as being inappropriate. Someone staked out a school playground to take a picture of an overweight child,it is now on more than one article on Wikipedia. How would you feel if that was YOU. Despite the fact the face is not visible she knows it is her, her friends probably do, so that's real nice being an example of an """"overweight child"""" on the internet for all the world to see. Although if someone wanted to tease her I don't think they would use a term a little less politically correct.Somehow that picture is o.k., Penfield's Homunculus, placed near a block of text describing the somatosensory cortex, not o.k., that makes no sense.

Radio Babylon is dub, it provides typical dub technique (small room/overreverbed room), and the only thing it can be called 'dnb' for is the combination of percusion with k-s-k-s-.. rhythm, which is hardly an invention of MBM. Four arguments to Radio Babylon opposition are:
MBM is an experimental band. (there has been already noted somewhere that Kraftwerk's 'Radioactivity' was once 'recognized' a first dubstep track by some)
Dub is a genre of vast (Can you definetely state no simillar dubtrack has been written just before /or much before Radio Babylon?)
MBM's track isn't related to Rave, as Dub (or reverb technique) isn't related to Rave
Two years passed till another tracks of jungle have appeared if Radio Babylon is considered a first track.

Arguments in favour are:
MBM are British, so they are connected somehow to British Rave scene.
Track's rhythm is quite a simillarity with jungle music rhythms.

Second argument is like 'drumfunk was created in the times jazz/funk drum improvisations appeared (20s to 60s)'. The first argument is weak without the second one.

One more argument that MBM's track is sampled in some jungle tracks as a straight shortcut to jungle music roots according to creators of those tracks. But it is quite a pov argument.

I don't know the roots of Rave, the scene was dominantly white, and the guy who brought acid house to UK was white too. But who started using 45rpm breakbeat over 4-tofloor is enigma to me personally.

Black music may be considered a 'racial term', therefore i think you'll enjoy more politcorrect one: 'Pop music genre created by black people of African/Carribean (may be also Indian) origin'. I asure, no one here wants it to start any racial war.  82.209.225.33",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ok, the argument regarding the Brandenburg class is this: What distinguishes the Dreadnought type from a pre-Dreadnought? As I understand it from the article the only requirement is the uniform main battery in bore diameter and barrel length. There is a whole list what the advantages are and the only ones the Brandenburg class did not meet due to the different barrel length is maximum range (the difference is nearly irrelevant in 1890 due to fire control abilities) muzzle velocity and thus flight time and splash distinction (irrelevant because of the low number of differing guns and the missing central fire control at this time). Dreadnought labeled ships had 6 inch guns as secondary armament while the Brandenburg had only 4 inch ones as next biggest after the main guns. The maximization of striking power on long range has to be seen in the context of the time, the long range is the maximum of guns and fire control, also the power of HE does not depend on muzzle velocity but on caliber (as used in the article, which was the same for all of the 6 guns) and even the Japanese used HE 15 years later with their big guns...
The other advantages of the armament rest on """"caliber"""" as used in the article (see """"#Main armament power and caliber""""), not on barrel length, like logistical simplicity. The fire control advantage from splashes is there for only 6 guns, and if 2 shells arrive even a bit later, it is even better for distinguishing shots with the non-central firecontrol in use at this time. The rate of fire was uniform and about 2 shells per minute as stated in the Brandenburg article, no problem there as well.
What about the rest of the design features of Dreadnought according to the article? Central fire control was not implemented in all the """"Dreadnought types"""" and if it was used, then to very different degrees. The position of the main armament on the Dreadnought itself was not optimal with the wing turrets, the Brandenburg was more advanced with only centerline turrets. That there were problems like the blast damage was not uncommen, Dreadnought ships had wet guns and so on as well. The armor was undergoing heavy changes before and after the Dreadnought, the Brandenburg class had composite armour, the all-or-nothing scheme came later than Dreadnought and the armor deck (plunging fire) was thicker on Brandenburg than on the Dreadnought 15 years later. The turbine was not used by early US Dreadnoughts and coal was used on much later British ships.
Interesting how ships not even having the same caliber (as in the article without barrel length) are mentioned as being semi-dreadnoughts and the Brandenburg class 15 years earlier only lacking the uniform barrel length but coming much closer to the """"Dreadnought description"""" in many other aspects than actual early Dreadnought is totally omitted...

The link you provide states that """"45% of the rail market in Sweden is privatised"""" that therefore makes saying """"Rail transport in Sweden is privatised"""" a falsification if more than half of the entire market is still owned by the government. It doesn't matter whether the rail market was """"liberalised"""" into different companies under state ownership e.g. SJ, something cannot be described as """"privatised"""" if it retains a majority of government ownership, because it is therefore nationalised, the opposite of privatisation. To describe the Swedish rail market as privatised and then list a state owned company which comprises it in the very same sentence is nonsense and this is exactly what you have written.

""""Rail transport market is privatized and companies include SJ.........."""" - In this sentence you have made it sound as if SJ is a private company which is untrue, since if the person reading clicks the SJ hyperlink, they will be taken to an article which states unambiguously that SJ is a government owned enterprise.

A much better thing to do would be to explain that the majority of passenger transport by rail in Sweden is operated by state owned companies such as SJ as well as the government run Lokal Trafik in place within each of Sweden's Län such as HallandsTrafik, Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, SkåneTrafik etc. etc. etc. and THEN to explain that some sectors of rail transport are privatised such as the transport of cargo. This would therefore align the content of the article with the reference you presented above, which states that the majority of rail transport in Sweden is still government owned (with 45% being privatised).

Since judging by your other edits you are a right winger with a serious beef against anything government owned, you could then satisfy yourself by writing that state owned SJ isn't the most efficient of rail networks, something which a lot of Swedes themselves agree on as far as I have seen. In my own experience delays are common and travelling with SJ can be expensive.

I will go into more detail once I have time to fully digest your argument, but for now, the Times article is entitled """"Doctor's syndrome a sham, board says"""". Our article reflects the content of that reliable source. I don't see any similarly reliable independent, fact-checked, third-party sources that have appeared in the intervening years to contradict that assessment - certainly the Board left the door open for medical science to corroborate Wilson's claims, but I see no reliably sourced evidence that such corroboration has occurred. Let's start with the best available sources on the topic, and follow where they lead - that's the gist of this site's policies and expectations. '''''' Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.

In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.

As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.

 Pullback of Sections vs. Pullback of Bundles 

Actually, there is a subtle point that this article gets wrong, and in fact many books get wrong (or fail to emphasize, although I believe it's because everyone learns it this way). Yes, I know that if it is wrong, I could just update it myself; but it looks like this will require a bit of rearrangement which I'm not quite in the mood to sort out now, and so it is best for me to give a brief statement of the issue here. It's also way past my bedtime, so, if anyone wants to help out while I'm sleeping, be my guest.

The problem is a terminological confusion which arises from using the term pullback for different (but related) things. For f  M → N a smooth map, there is usually not a smooth bundle map from T*N to T*M (unless f is a diffeomorphism). There is a pointwise map of individual cotangent spaces f*p  Tf(p) N → Tp M for every p, defined by operation with the pushforward of a vector in the corresponding tangent space (it is the transpose of the pushfoward on individual tangent spaces). But for the general point q in N we can't pull back to M unless we have a way of choosing a point in f-1(q) (which is especially problematic if f is not onto...). However, we can pull back sections of the cotangent bundle (i.e. covector field, and this applies in general to covariant tensor fields). The """"pullback"""" everyone talks about is a map from covector fields on N to covector fields on M, that is, given ω: N → T*N a section, we define f*ω  M → T*M  by

where f*p is just the pointwise pullback defined before. This is always well-defined. Note that this is just the opposite of the problem with vectors and their fields (and in general, contravariant tensor fields): in that case, there is a pushforward which is a smooth bundle map of the tangent bundles, but in general vector field does not push forward unless the map is a diffeomorphism. It has been remarked in several books that the co-objects seem to have this wonderful extra structure, of being able to pull back sections. What really happened is that it gave up the capability to induce a smooth bundle map of the bundles in the process, thus restoring one aspect of """"duality"""" that seems to have been broken when dealing with this subject.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

In my opinion, the section is okay. bin Laden's death is certainly going to have major effects on countries/groups involved, namely US, Pakistan and al-Qaeda.

So, having sections that focus particularly on these 2 countries is completely appropriate. However, should we add such a section right now? No, we shouldn't when we don't even know for sure what those effects are.—c/t """,0,0,0,0,0,0

To expand on one aspect of that: Wikipedia's three main content policies are:
WP:Neutral point of view, which Peridon mentioned,
WP:Verifiability: """"all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source... The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—whether readers can check that material in Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether editors think it is true.""""
WP:No original research: """"The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published source exists.""""
The last two mean that content based on your """"extensive participation in two of the three events (making me VERY knowledgeable of what occurred both in public and private, with a bare minimum of conjecture)"""" is not acceptable as a basis for additions to the article.

Hey brownaddictUK, welcome to wikipedia.

I'm all for harm minimisation & abstaining from addictions, but this is a place to provide factual information on subjects.  To put a link to an external link to a website, it has to have some further specific information about a subject, or for the purpose of verfiying information in the article.  The website you added doesn't fit either of these categories.

But i would like to invite you to contribute factual information to wikipedia, judging by the list of articles you added the link to, you seem to have a fairly good knowledge of drug related issues, maybe you could share that by contributing to articles.

If you need general help, look at Help and the FAQ, and if you can't find your answer there, check the Village pump (for Wikipedia related questions) or the Reference Desk (for general questions).

 thank you for your input... this is exactly what the """"article"""" needed.  The parts of the article that are being removed are not significant parts and rather are blatant negative attacks.

Keep the """"facts"""" (and i use this word lightly with this group) positive and help the school advance and produce better and more qualified physicians.  Prospective students can always call up their own state board, or the school's offices and ask questions.  If anyone has proof that the CURRENT administration or school officials are lying to students (prospective or current) about possible licensure issue or charter issues or anything for that matter then yes the school should have something formally brought against them.  From what i see the school has been and is currently being investigated by the GMC.  Should the GMC find problems that are beyond repair then the school will be closed, and then no need to bash anymore because the school will fade away.  Portraying the situation as constantly negative helps no one at all.

Hi, you just made a false claim in an edit summary for cdrtools: You claimed that """"cdrkit"""" was created in 2006. This is not correct. The Debian initiated fork was created in May 2004 and later (on my request) it was just renamed to """"cdrkit"""". All the Debian initiated bugs in the fork from 2004 appear in what was later called """"cdrkit"""", so this is obviously the fork from 2004 that was created because Debian wanted to ship a broken variant from cdrtools after their related patch was rejected for quality reasons.

Premiere of Season 4
Who keeps changing the date season 4 premiered to september 14th? Because the official fetch website had an ad before it premiered saying it would preimere on sepetmber 11th right on it's home page!!! So please stop editing it back to the 14th.

I know but only some stations had it the 11th. The 11th was only a sneak peek and then the season officially started on the 14th. If you look at tv.com it has it listed as the 14th. Also since some stations had there program sechedules messed up, I say lets have it say the 14th. I did get a hold of WGBH and they did say it was a sneak peek. The site just said when the season was kind of starting. Also, the episode aired omn the 11th and then reaired on the 14th with the rest of of season.

Hi there. I hope you find the references regarding the road signage to be adequate. The pictorials are embedded deeply within the refs. The refs are legitimate, although refs are extremely difficult to find on an issue like this. But if you're well familiar with Bergen County roads, you'll know that these four-municipal directional signs are not only ubiquitous but actually very practical in navigating around the county's towns and have been around for decades in conjunction with the county's development. They also are not found anywhere else, to my knowledge. Thus, I believe they warrant mention in the article.

Many people in the UK (including me) believe that in time, the proceedings so far will prove to have been a major miscarriage of justice and UK newspapers are increasingly reporting it as such e.g. London Evening Standard - 14-10-10.  The case is notable, not just as another  murder, but for the breathtakingly incompetent nature of the investigation and for the internet wide sociological phenomena of a modern day 'witch hunt' pursued by those who think that Knox and Sollecito are guilty.  The entry above illustrates this.  The introduction of racism into the debate is unnecessary.  The protagonists need to be judged on evidence.  Implying that race is a factor is arguably inflammatory and seeks to divert attention from the evidence.  It is a good idea for Wikepedia to seek to present as full a picture of the proceedings as possible including the post trial phenomena of internet trolling on the subject.

f350a0ac1c5df6d2,"""Student essay editing...==
Andy, if you are so keen, then you are encouraged to make the improvements.  These contributions are inferior in many ways as is being widely discussed not only by myself but others.  The rest of us have day jobs, so limited time to contribute.  As you probably know from your teaching experiences, repairing student essays take hours of effort and time.  Sincerely said, I just dont think that these unsupervised contributions from students are of the technical or stylistic standards we are accustomed to in Wikipedia.  The graphics are copyright violations, the article are often violate WP:NOTTEXTBOOK and are preachy or making value judgements.  The referencing ignores WP:SECONDARY.  If you find these massive additions, salvageable, then you can join the completely absent instructor in editing.  We really hope that you can help with content!    
I find your mass removal of good faith contributions by new editors, and your repeatedly pejorative descriptions of them, both outwith the spirit of Wikipedia (WP:BITE, WP:AGF), and disruptive (WP:POINT). If you are too busy to make fixes, that's OK, you are not personally required to do so - just leave the material for others to fix.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 
As I have already indicated, at that stage in my traiing would have submitted similarly awful essays. So my pejorative comments are directed at the so-called ambassadors-coordinators-instructors who foster and protect such inappropriate and poorly crafted content.  Like you, they are waiting and praying for someone with writing skills to intervene.  But as you're discovering, determined mediocrity can be difficult to rectify within the fringes of Wikipedia.  Looking forward to your help with editing these and other articles.   
Those people may have been your intended targets, but that's quite clearly not the result you achieved; here as elsewhere. And no, I do not pray.  (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 
There is no result to be achieved ... the students dropped their essay bomb on Wikipedia and got their grades.  The ambassadors-coordinators-instructors are flush with approval that they are """"encouraging"""" and """"nuturing"""" and being innovative in their engagement of Wikipedia.

 Climate data 

An unregistered editor keeps adding climate data to the article, but I have removed it because it isn't clear where the data has been gathered. The unregistered editor has provided a source for the data - http://www.myweather2.com - but I am yet to be convinced that that source can be considered reliable, and anyway it also very clearly states that """"The climate profile is taken from closest available data source to North Chideock"""", which is not the same as stating the data was gathered actually in Chideock. It is quite likely the data was gathered at a weather station such as on the Isle of Portland or at Yeovilton in Somerset, and because of this I consider it misleading to the reader to present the info in the article as if it applied specifically to Chideock.In addition, some of the text added by the unregistered editor was not supported by the source - for example, the claim that Chideock is one of the sunniest places in the UK.

, please, just think about what you're saying here. Let's take this by the numbers:

 Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at User talk:Black Kite . Your suggestion that HighKing should """"step back from this type of edit"""" is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.
 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.
 Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!
 Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true. The idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tell the truth on Wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous, a view no admin should be seen within a hundred miles of holding, let alone repeating.
 Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a """"long term campaign of harassment"""" without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.
 To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an """"inappropriate"""" use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Micky, 

Hey, not sure if my last message went out or not. My system sort of froze up for a bit and I could not log back on for a bit.

The gist of what I typed folows:

Not intending to be a smart aleck but the seal, as opposed to the coat of arms doesn't appear in color officially. I think Deb Markowitz, secreatary of stae for Vermont would back up that it is a single color device. I really do like the seal, it was deisgned by Ira Allen, and is refreshingly differnet from most others. Perhaps a trifle naïve in design but a nice device. It was designed to have dies cut for embossing so it is high contrast line art not showing shafiding or multiple colors.  

If you take a look at the staes of Maine, California, Michigan, you note more of a full color with shading and dpeth sort of treatment. these though labled """"seals"""" are all heraldically like a coat of arms. If we look at nations, like the Netherlands, UK, Canda, we see coats of arms. American civic heraldry is different. Vermont like many of our older east coast states has a coat of arms that is described by a statute, what can be called a blazon. Because vermont's coat of arms is so great I would love to see it used somewhere. Maybe as an illustration on the Vermont page, and as its own entry. If the word """"Seal"""" in the sidebar is boiler plate and can not be changed to coat of arms, could we use a solis dark green or medium gray without the color? And, possibly use the more colorful coat of arms, for the state links at botom of page. 

It's a thought. I grew up in Vermont. I see you are from Enlgand. What part? I am doing a signage and branding project in Sevenoaks, Kent at present.

Best,

I don't want to go about beating around a dead Bantha, but after reviewing the sequence of the transformation on DVD I discovered something interesting when viewing the scene in slow motion within chronological order. In one shot, we see Palpatine's face becoming the Sidious of the OT, followed by more lightning to the face. After a few close-ups on a conflicted Anakin, the camera focuses back on Palpatine, who is still in a transitional state but is lacking the details present in the previous shot. It is as if the Sidious face is showing through once as the lightning is interacting with the skin, and then fading away, and then finally breaking through again as the Palpatine face melts away and Sidious says he's too weak to continue. If Palpatine was indeed literally deformed by the lighting, why did his face go from normal, to Sidious, to semi-normal, and back to Sidious again. If the lightning wounded him, wouldn't the wounds stay instead of suddenly disappearing and re-appearing? Watch your DVDs, you'll see it. I have a few screen shots that I can provide to show you what I am referring to. By the way, both this and the regular Wikipedia article fail to make any mention of Sidious' strange voice after he rises from the window sill and before he puts on his hood. In the commentary, Lucas said he added synthesized effects to the voice to make the """"true Sidious"""" drip a bit more menace. That's all well and good, but there must be a within-universe explanation for it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for your response. I just want to say that the 2 things that I believe should be changed in the article Cyrus the Great is that 
1. That he was the King of Āryāvarta
2. His influence reached till Indus River

If you go through the histories and historic maps properly then you will find that King Cyrus has never Indus. And as far as  Āryāvarta is concerned then it starts from Indus and spreads over Gangetic Plains. In history it can be clearly seen that there was no influence of King Cyrus on these areas. In fact King Cyrus' kingdom extended till today's Baluchistan province in Pakistan but have never reached till Indus River.Even the maps this article contains proves the same thing.

 History of Liverpool F.C. 

Hi, I have reverted your latest edit because it appears to be a verbatim quotation from someone else's work, and therefore, if not a breach of copyright, plagiarism. We cannot do this, for legal reasons. May I invite you to rewrite it in your own words, adding a citation to your source? That would fix the problem. Thanks. andemu 
Editors have moved further information to the History article to make sure that we present a coherent and concise description of LFC as a whole. We should have only the most relevant and important info in the main article. E.g. That the City of Liverpool has made a World Cup bid is verging on off topic, especially when LFC's involvement is only with the use of its stadium. The rail station info has nothing to do with LFC in the slightest.
Liverpool's split from Everton was already mentioned, and described in detail in the article about Liverpool FC's history. What facts exactly am I supposed to be """"getting over""""?   
Also, I do not like being described as a vandal. Especially when that's clearly not how I've been acting. It's quite insulting. Please read here for a description of what a """"vandal"""" is.   
Agreed. Removal of unsourced information, particularly if it may be a breach of WP:COPYRIGHT is not vandalism and saying that it is breaches our policy on personal attacks. Please don't add it back without citing its source, and certainly not without rewriting in your own words in a narrative style, because I'm afraid if you do, you will be blocked from editing here. Furthermore, references to Hitler are equally likely to get you blocked. Please take some time getting used to our policies before going much further. Thanks. andemu 
Abstract
OK, well we now have a citation- thanks- but merely quoting from an abstract isn't quite there yet. What we need to say is something like """"In a study by Leeds University researchers X and Y, it was stated that .. """", although if different researchers have come to different conclusions or present different facts, this should also be mentioned (with sourcing) for balance. andemu 
Believe it or not, we are trying to help you here, but I've had to remove this university study again- the citation you gave just did not support the content you added, and therefore, your edit failed verifiability policy. You need to take points from a full, published, version, not just an abstract. Even if it is your own work, it is original research and not permitted here. Any further disruption may lead to a block, but at least that would give you some time to read other articles to see how they are written, and sourced. andemu 

OK, I've rewritten it to cite the research. There is no need for there to be a section on the research; the article is about the club, not the research. Hopefully that shuold get us somewhere. UK

 Stillman inference 

a paragraph in the article, citing pp 14-16 of Stillman's 1979 work, reads as follows:

According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself and avoid being accused of double standards given the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir. Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.

however, the only relevant discussion i found was this (p.15):

When all hope was gone they [i.e. Qurayza] sought to surrender on the same terms as had the Naḍīr. This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā c at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. Muhammad then declared that this was none other than Allah's decision. Actually, it is clear from the Muslim sources that the Qurayza's fate had been decided even before their surrender. One of Muhammad's emissaries, Abū Lubāba, who had advised the Qurayẓa to give up, had to perform penance for hinting to the Jews what their real fate would be.

Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.again, with the second sentence in the article, i do not see how the solitary sentence discussing Abu Lubaba substantiates what has been written, or where Stillman is making any """"infer[ences]"""" that Banu Qurayza's fate had already been decided by Muhammad before their surrender.  
This is clear from the last two sentences of the excerpt. The first sentence states the conclusion; the second contains the premise.  Or 
could you also address the first point?  
This is clear from the following setences:This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā at the request of their former allies the Khazraj.

Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.
 Or 
i have provided that extract above, and commented on it: Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting",0,0,0,0,0,0

First, you are misreading what your first source is. The document you reference is a UN interum report on Resolution 425. 425 dates back to 1978. That document (the report) does not reflect any agreement between the UN and Israel. 425 calls for many things, but there had been no public pledge from Israel on dismantling the SLA. In fact, Israel in public had been saying the opposite. They were not planning to leave until early July. The report being issued on the 22nd isn't very meaningful. Its coincidence. There was a whole series of meetings between the SLA (see later material) and UN/various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on 425.

Second, I think its better to deal with Charbel Barakat's fuller and more accurate version of what happened in May from his congressional testimony in June 2000:

""""During the month of May 2000 our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the United Nations in Nakura in south Lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus. During the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the US, UK, and French embassies in Israel and at the United Nations. And on May 18, our representatives met with the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York ... Instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously, the United Nations declined to assist us ... The United States, UK and France dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the Beirut regime ... The State of Israel only prepared for our potential exodus, ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves.""""

""""Despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds, our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the UN to deploy its units around our villages. 
On May 22, 2000, and as Israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the SLA was absent in France, the mostly Shiite sector of the security zone collapsed. It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave before the borders closed. Even after the invasion of Hizbollah of this area, the mostly Christian-Druse eastern enclave and the Christian western enclave, decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after Israel’s withdrawal.
On May 23, 2000, at 8 PM, SLA officers in the western sector received orders from the Israelis to leave their posts as Hizbollah was advancing towards their villages. Thus the SLA was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle. The main reason why the SLA did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back. Without access to medical and logistical supplies, our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border."""" (from [www.10452lccc.com/special%20studies/barakatjune2000.htm])

The SLA did collapse. What Charbel Barakat is talking about in the MEF comments is that the remainder of the SLA (Christian) in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by Israel. But it was only dismanted after most of the SLA had collapsed. Charbel Barakat and other dead-enders may have wanted (in theory anyway) to fight on in the west, but Israel wasn't going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the SLA going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border. The caution I would give about Barakat and a couple others from the SLA is that sometimes they think of their Christian portion of the SLA as if it were the entire SLA. And from that point of view, the SLA did not collapse and was dismantled by Israel.

The biggest claim made by Barakat is in weasel-words: """"It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave"""". 'It appeared that"""" means he is guessing. Nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the Shites were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the 22nd. Even Barakat is unwilling to make that claim.

Now lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn't know about with regard to the SLA collapse. But the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the Israeli government and army. Nobody in the SLA knows much of anything because if Israel was going to collapse them, they would hardly tell them their plan. People (including me) can make lots of hunches and theories about what might have happened, but there are no facts to back any of those theories up.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

If Wikipedia decides to semi-protect or totally protect a generic conceptual confusion, then stupidity must have reached its top. Worse than that can it not become. An encyclopedia that guards total conceptual confusion with all its forces must be a world and historical record of stupidity. Can the editors of Wikipedia really agree on protection of conceptual confusion, like, """"yes, the article about clade is a mess and we protect this mess. We also protect propagation of this mess into other concepts in this encyclopedia. We do not allow any resolving contribution of this confusion anywhere in this encyclopedia. It is a cladistic encyclopedia. We like conceptual messes"""". Such protection would at least be typically cladistic. (Take care, because cladistics does actually deny that 1=1).

Wikipedia:LGBT notice board
This explains a lot of the experience I've had in LGBT articles, this is used as a recruitment point to spread LGBT based propaganda.  They are not the slightest bit interested in POV and get offended when you delete clearly POV and unsubstantiated, dubious content.  They suggest you basically write the article from scratch for them since it's crap, because to them it's better to keep in totally incorrect propaganda then have a small article.

They insist on making a million different articles covering every topic, sub-topic and sub-sub-topic on everything related to LGBT stuff (notice the abundance of """"Homosexuality and"""" type articles), there is TONS of redundant information.  They're basically among the most close-minded POV pushers on Wikipedia and given their persistence it's an annoying problem.  The herd is noticeable on VfD pages, 4 of the 7 votes to keep the pro-feminism article, for example, came through recruited from this wikipedia notice board.  7 votes were for deletion, because clearly the article made no sense to exist (it's all just reiterating feminist beliefs whilst repeating """"pro-feminist men believe..."""" over and over).

The proposal is to split the article into Reading to Taunton Line, Exeter to Plymouth Line and Bristol to Exeter Line which would include a merger of Bristol to Taunton Line with the Taunton-Exeter sections in this article. The main advantages for this are;

1) The three articles would more accurately represent the history of the lines in question. This article includes the Berks and Hants Railway as well as only a small section of the Bristol to Exeter Railway and the South Devon Railway. Three articles concerning the modern day equivalents of these railways would be a better basis for the articles than the arbitrary cut-offs that are currently employed.

2)The three articles would more accurately tie-in with other articles. For example, the article Disused railway stations (Bristol to Exeter Line) would cover all closed stations from a single article instead of the one and a quarter that it currently does.

3)The articles will more accurately mirror current services, this especially applies to CrossCountry services that only operate between Bristol and Plymouth and South West Trains that only operate between Exeter and Plymouth.

Except the video I haven't seen anyone naming him as Mohammed Afroz except the video of IndiaToday earlier tagged there and as far as I remember the Delhi police never revealed his name. So I am highly doubtful. Despite whatever his name is, WP:BLPNAME prevents from naming someone whose name has been intentionally omitted officially including in court records and isn't allowed to be named publicly. In the case of a rape victim, the family can reveal the name and the family of Nirbhaya did. However the juvenile isn't allowed ti be named under Juvenile Justice Act. Additionally the victimisation and probable threat on his life if his name is revealed also makes another case why his name shouldn't be there whether the name the sources gave might be wrong or true. Therefore, I am in agreement the previous edit versions containing all the various versions of his real name like Sunil and Mohammed Afroz should be deleted.   04:06, 8",0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you for that answer, but that's not what I asked. Have you or have you not read Mussolini's autobiography and speeches? That wasn't my question either; that's a new one. If you have, then you would know that claims of Fascism being anti-clerical is absurd (the position of individual anti-clerical self-professed Fascists is irrelevant to the ideology of Fascism itself). You would have to resort to conspiracy, as the would-be scholars have, and claim that Mussolini's ideology of Fascism was all a huge front and that he secretly was anti-Clerical and secretly considered anti-Clericalism intrinsic to Fascism. How convenient. And as for Darwinism, which was my other point, you won't find anything on that either. Mussolini never even stated anything about evolution (nor did Hitler, for that matter). Did he believe in evolution? Considering the times he lived in, probably. But he never mentioned it, let alone social Darwinism.

 RE: NIGHT OF HUNTERS 

Thank you for contributing as well!  I've been enjoying it, too.  Yeah, I understand the confusion about the tour.  My instinct would've been to do the same thing you did until I read Newsom's album page.  I just thought it flowed better and, when you think of it, in about 6 months, the tour will be """"background"""" info for the album, i.e. how it was promoted.

So yeah.  I'm also adding a new blurb from a rather fantastically written review.  It's a blog, but it's so well written and we have so little professional reviews written, I think it'll do nicely for now (I may decide to keep it there altogether) ;)

Thanks for dropping me a message and thanks for all the help/support!

Can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty.  I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as """"problematic"""".  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. 

I feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.
I hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of """"these commercial products"""" is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.

Thanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.  But it bothers me when someone questions that I am not working hard enough or they question my ethics, and that's what your comments feel like.  All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).  New people grow and adjust - but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community.  Please be patient and encouraging to new people.

I'm going to leave this discussion now.  If needed, I will return to it after the holiday season.  But I hope there is no need to.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello. You had some interaction with IP  in connection with the Golan Heights  so accordingly, I am notifying you and Stifle of a matter that is of serious concern.
 
I have reason to believe that this IP user is Nableezy trying to circumvent a topic ban imposed on him by Stifle. The ban forbids him from editing or commenting on the Golan Heights and all areas of Israel and its environs including cities, settlements and regions.
 
The IP in question geolocates to Chicago  and the edit in question is consistent with Nableezy’s POV.  Prior to the instant edits, the IP never made any edits to the topic area and the first edit that he makes in the topic area is to The Golan Heights. 

Nableezy is also from Chicago as evidenced from his early Trait Page
 
But there is more. The subject IP also made edits to a hockey article involving players in the NHL. Nableezy has expressed more than a passing interest for this subject as evidenced by this 
 
But the similarities between the IP user and nableezy do not end there. The subject IP made this edit on a very technical subject involving circuitry and electronics. 
 
Nableezy attended Illinois Institute of Technology, a school that emphasizes engineering and IT evidenced by his early Trait List 
 
So now we have an IP who, like Nableezy, comes from Chicago with interests in the Golan Heights, Hockey and IT. The coincidences are too great to ignore per WP:DUCK. The evidence suggests that The IP is Nableezy's sock puppet used to circumvent Stifle's topic ban.",0,0,0,0,0,0

IT IS A RELIABLE SOURCE. Here is the analysis which I was simply trying to source from the page itself. Some of this is already in UON could I source that instead for the EXACT SAME CHANGE? My site, which is my lifes work as a master was deemed unreliable by non-chess players. Here is the analysis in regards to the pinksi line.
These guys wont understand it because chess is too complicated for them but lets us hope that some other strong player who cares about how low quality wikipedia chess articles are will come by and confirm that my add was reliable instead of these random non-chess players burying it in revisions.

Kaufman the all knowing all seeing eye atop the pyramid and Euwe and 100 year old player who would not even be able to beat my laptop in chess. Beware the innocuous PINSKI REFUTATION THAT IS NOT REALLY A REFUTATION

Maybe if I was Carlsen this guy would stop undoing my edits and saying my """"personal website"""" was unreliable. Or maybe not! Maybe Carlsen can not edit Wikipedia. Maybe this is Carlsen in disguise!! Think of how many people RELY on wikipedia. People RELY on experts in their fiedls. But what happens when the experts get ignored?! I guess my master title in chess is toilet paper. So are my chess puzzles. My """"self-published"""" book is probably garbage. Maybe I should delete my """"personal"""" website because its not Krabbes site which this guy likes better because he likes Krabbe better than Zimbeck. In his eyes, judging Zimbeck by one comment made about the opening being playable. What this guy does not know, is theory changes and thats why they call it theory.

Depth of focus DOF is a lens optics concept that measures the tolerance of placement of the image plane (the film plane in a camera) in relation to the lens. 
While the phrase depth of focus was historically used, and is sometimes still used, to mean depth of field, in modern times it is more often reserved for the image-side depth. Depth of field is a measurement of depth of acceptable sharpness in the object space, or subject space. Depth of focus, however, is a measurement of how much distance exists behind the lens wherein the film plane will remain sharply in focus. It can be viewed as the flip side of depth of field, occurring on the opposite side of the lens. Where depth of field often can be measured in macroscopic units such as meters and feet, depth of focus is typically measured in microscopic units such as fractions of a millimeter or thousandths of an inch. Since the measurement indicates the tolerance of the film's displacement within the camera, depth of focus is sometimes referred to as """"lens-to-film tolerance.""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Vascular parkinsonism is produced by one or more small strokes that affect the basal ganglia. A stroke is the loss of activity of a discreet brain area (lesion) because of blockage of the blood supply to that brain region. Vascular diseases are associated with a higher prevalence of Parkinson's Disease [1]. There are three different pathologic states that produce Vascular Parkinsonism (VP), including multiple lacunar infarctions in the basal ganglia area [2,3], subcortical arteriosclerotic changes (Binswanger's disease) [2,3] and a single vascular lesion that present a clinical picture indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease [2,3,4]. Parkinson's Disease symptoms occur in Vascular Parkinsonism [5-12]. However, resting tremor is either reduced [5,6], or absent [7,8]. Only a minority, but a large minority, of people with Vascular Parkinsonism respond to L-dopa [9,10].

I am a student at Drake University enrolled in a Wikipedia:Wiki Ed/Drake University/Global Youth Studies (Fall 2015):course that is striving toward taking out the systemic bias out of Wikipedia. My proposed edit is not extensive yet, but I am using my sources to explain the global side of popular music. It also explains how it is difficult to label something as popular music or not. I touched on the connection between world music and being labeled as an """"exotic other."""" I chose a couple of genres of music that are popular in different countries to explain how something may be popular in one context, but not another. The edit also discusses how the digitization of music has impacted the popular music field by allowing artists to become famous through social media. I am still not totally confident with my edit because it is very short at this point and I am nervous that I am trying to discuss different genres too in depth. I am also nervous that I am trying to make an argument out of this article because I am discussing the different countries' popular music genres. Later this week or this weekend I will be linking my proposed edit to this talk page. Thank you!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hi Edward. You have a few options. First is to start on the article talk page, which I see you've already done. I know a few days has already gone by, but maybe ping your posting again and see what happens. 
 Your next step would be to bring this to WP:RPP and request semi-protection, but make sure you have your evidence at hand. Gather a few diffs (both your edits and the IP edits), and show that you've attempted resolution on the talk page. Look at other requests for PP and see what the standard type of format is, and successful or denied reasons; that'll give you a good idea how to submit your request. If the reviewing admin agrees, the page won't be editable by IP editors. Semi-page protection usually is usually a finite period of time, but after protection lapses, you can re-request it if need be. Just mention previous page protections on any subsequent requests.
 I'd also look at WP:ANI, where you can post for admin intervention. If semi-PP is denied, I'd go here, but there may not be much that they can do. Since it's a school IP address range, admins are generally hesitant to block those types of IPs. Yngvarr """,0,0,0,0,0,0

great, but what I meant about weakest link is that I don't see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources I've seen, have you got a source that place's something called """"post-industrial"""" in the context of the history of noise music? (I'm presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the 'post' tag).

Unless the sources are good on this, it's too divergent, in my opinion, to include right now. Some of what might be called post-industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn't warrant inclusion. You might as well do a section on death-metal and its precursors, but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward; especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as """"noise music"""".

Personally, I think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music, or any composer/artist, that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making, and I don't think that is what should happen with this article, unless the claims are sourced, and that's why I mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. We now see a number of artists (for example Jeff Mills) being redefined as a post-industrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year 2000 despite the fact that Mills has been associated with techno for 20 years now. I find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0
