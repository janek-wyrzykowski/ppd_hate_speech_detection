 My response to Mr Nathanael ,corcerning his astrological beliefs along with his biased and bossy behavior in wikipedia

The problem with Mr Nathanael is that loves to act like a self proclaimed Administrator here in wikipedia and deleting even reliable sources from other members that contradict his own personal beliefs (or his friends) from his picked sources and i am not talking only about deleting Astrology-online but other sources too that i citated and Mr Nathanael try to delete them with some unjustified cheap excuse.... 

Here is one example below of Mr Nathanael bossy behavior here in wikipedia from the Scorpio History page when i contributed a reliable source from Kelli Fox (A professional Astrologer as i clearly pointed him with a url of her homepage)

Hi Peripitus, The images added have been used by various websites and they are commonly spread over the internet and people are using it. If you search google you will find how frequent these images are being used and i have added the common ones and not the rare which leads to copyright violation as if that would be the case then no one would have used it except the copyrighted holder....

Hi Suraj845. That is a common and understandable misconception. The images are copyrighted when created and most uses, including by most websites, without the authorisation of images owner is a breach of that copyright. Copyright is widely ignored across many websites, and I presume that it is too much trouble for the copyright holder (if they notice) to get them to remove the images. Some of the sites you see images on, though, have permission of the copyright holder to display the image. This permission does not extend to this site. Wikipedia seeks to only host free content (""""Wikipedia - the Free Encyclopedia"""") except when there is no option and the use of the image meets the strict rules for this.

I don't think the definition from Webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written (1917) . The idea that professionals """"supply disinterested counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain"""" is a bit naive, particularly in the I think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.
For instance, in the light of Holocaust, in which many German professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state, which would tend to indicate that """"service for others"""" may not be have the intention, but was taken to a tragic extreme. Likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker (if it is a profession) has shown to conducted wholly for business gain (i.e. higher profit, larger bonuses), whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain, often to the detriment to the business (e.g. accountants in the Enron scandal). 
I am not saying that Perks is the ideal source of information, but would suggest we need to cast around for a better definition, and one that is couched in more modern language.  (talk|contribs) 16:44, 1 November""",0,0,0,0,0,0

SchroCat is applying the general rule in British English, that is when """"out"""" is prefixed to a noun or verb it is usually hyphenated, and is correct in the case of """"pre-arrange"""", which is hyphenated in the OED. However, """"outgross"""" is unique because it is of American origin and adopted into British English; in this instance the OED have adopted the American usage of leaving out the hyphen. If the word was not listed in the OED I think it would be justifiable to apply the general British rule of hyphenating, but since the OED has accepted it in its general American form we should probably follow suit.

 Angel 

Well, yeah I'm a bit miffed to be honest. It's okay. Buffy Season Eight is a barrel of godly goodness, and by comparison Angel feels like Amazons Attack. Characterizations are off, I'm afraid. Connor's introduction felt ... crappy. Wesley's been introduced in the wrong way - don't jump him into a new role and backtrack characterization, do a Giles where you see him maybe two panels at a time and flesh him out through his own internal monologue. Lynch is a Spike fan, and he's projecting weird lusty desires onto Spike (vicariously?) - although Spike's not above the occasional Buffybot, it seems so strange. Strangest of all is Illyria. I would imagine she would either be desolate and destructive, walking about town killing without rest, or in some way secluded and shattered. For some reason it reminds me of Marvel vs. DC, where writers decided """"why introduce them cleverly? just have them start wailing on each other!"""" I also am trying my hardest to like Urru's style, but personally I think Jeanty and Lee are so much better, the slightly cartoony style better captures the tone of the series. Perhaps somebody like Nicola Scott would have been a better choice for Angel (by bizarre coincidence, going on her page after recommending her, she's done Illyria comics for IDW before!).

I'd say a good quality of the series is Betta George. I think 12 issues may be too long if this is the pace Lynch is going to have, and I'd have liked to see another writer try the Fight Night double-issue. I hate these publisher-exclusive contracts - I wish Geoff Johns or somebody could give it a go. I feel the book needs more pace, and better humour. Fix those two things and the other faults will fizzle away.~Talk to me! """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Oddly enough, I am truly agnostic on this particular bit of software. It's always been my position that it should have a fair trial, but it seems that at every step things have been problematic.  First off, there was the fact it was introduced immediately on the heels of two other major UI changes (the addition of revision deletion to the admin toolkit, and the switchover to Vector).  Then there was the fact that the version on the test wiki was *not* the version to be introduced here, so nobody could even test it properly on the testwiki.  The trial criteria were not developed until just days before the trial itself, and there were no benchmarks set to determine whether or not there was any change over time, or whether that change was positive or negative. The majority of early supporters in the original PC poll wanted it to be focused on BLPs, but for some reason at the end of the poll it was decided that PC should be applied to currently protected or semi-protected articles instead, and those were the articles targeted in the trial. The WMF press on the subject specifically referred to the ability for anonymous and newly-registered users to edit long-time semi-protected articles of high profile topics (the George W. Bush article was specifically mentioned), without discussing this in advance with the community. (It lasted less than 2 days on pending changes, with mountains of vandalism during that period.) Then there was the promise by the lead developer that PC would be shut off at the end of 60 days unless the community clearly requested otherwise. Four days later, when lead developer responsibility changed hands, the new lead developer announced that he would rather keep things running during any review, on a quiet page with only the most interested editors watching.  Even with all of this disarray, I still hoped that we could get a reasonable trial of the tool. It was agreed that we'd start off with 2000 articles in the trial, starting with just a few and ramping up so that we'd hit the 2K articles around 2 weeks into the trial, with the expectation that if things went well, we'd add more incrementally, perhaps up to 10K; however, only a handful of administrators participated in adding articles to the trial, and I don't think we ever got above 1500.  Further, at that point, we'd pretty well added all of the articles that were eligible under the criteria for the trial, except for ones in categories where one or more administrator had objected to inclusion; as best I can tell, their objections were based on the articles being honey pots for socks.  I was one of the most active admins in adding articles to the trial, and I confess I sneaked in a pile of BLPs that technically didn't meet the criteria (they had been semi-protected in the previous 6 months and had fewer than 10 watchers). Indeed, one of the most telling factors on this trial was the fact that very, very few administrators appeared to be interested in using the tool as currently configured. I also note that the time that it has taken edits to be reviewed has continued to lengthen as time has gone on. A few weeks ago, I led a panel on the topic of Pending changes at the New York City Wiki-conference. Thanks to DGG, Becksguy and Jamesofur, who were also on the panel.   That same day, keynote speaker Clay Shirky talked about the fact that once a culture is """"broken"""", it is not able to rebound back to its prior state. In my own closing statement, I reflected on that comment, and wondered if pending changes might be the """"culture-breaker"""" for Wikipedia and, if it was, whether or not that would be a good or bad thing. Certainly the manner in which this entire trial has proceeded has shown that there are some pretty huge differences in what people perceive as the way we do things around here. I don't think  the pending changes software or its use will be the culture breaker, but the manner in which it is being integrated and promoted into the project might very well be. I am very considerably concerned that this pressure to keep a bit of trial software running has resulted in a level of divisiveness between good-faith Wikipedians from which the community may not recover.

 POV  talk section moved 

POV

i've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity template lest i be reported for """"edit warring"""" by humus.   i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portals in the """"see also"""" section.   these links are more fitting than claiming this is """"part of the series on christianity""""

this article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff.  a lengthy """"criticism"""" section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section.  the missionaries are """"taught to speak in hebrew"""" (these people already went to hebrew school!) and jfj is known to """"target vulnerable jews"""" (oh really?) and """"most of the funding comes from christians"""" (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews?) and the current leader """"is not jewish"""" (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)

some of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion.  most come from biased publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards.  including these references is analogous to editing the """"buddhism"""" article to say that """"all buddhists will burn in hell"""" along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone website.

anyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article.  it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus  every missionary movement is opposed by someone.

 

Friend, your edits pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that """"NPOV"""" 

Thanks for the """"friend"""", nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of """"pushing my delusions"""".   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that """"all"""" """"mainstream"""" jewish groups, including """"secular"""" groups """"strongly"""" oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who """"all"""" the """"mainstream"""" jewish groups are, and what degree of """"opposition"""" is """"strong"""".  Can you really not see this simple truth?
Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs """"vulnerable jews"""" are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were """"vulnerable"""" to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches """"vulnerable jews"""".
It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers """"strongly oppose"""" DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be """"strongly opposed"""" to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same.
Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.   In the article """"christianity"""" is there a section labeled """"incompatibility with paganism"""" and """"a belief that is incompatible with paganism"""" and """"all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity""""?   Do we see """"incompatibility with catholicism"""" in the protestant article?   I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete.
What are the further objections?   Yes, the group may be called """"Jews for Jesus"""" and that offends people, but what would you have them call themselves?   Would """"Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish"""" be better?  They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet.   They also used Steve Jobs and Curious George, and a whole bunch of others, but i don't see Steve Jobs supporters here furious about Jews for jesus """"deceiving"""" ipod owners into believing in jesus.

(Sources: """"Wanted Fugitive Raul Gomez Garcia Extradited to the U.S."""" (US Embassy in Mexico) and Mexico alters extradition rules (BBC News)). There may be merit in a future section explaining the shifting interpretations, but I suggest that this should not be given undue prominence, and should be carefully checked against the nuances of what appears to be subtly shifting jurisprudence.

Arbitration enforcement action appeal by Yossiea~enwiki

Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found here. According to the procedures, a """"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors"""" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).

 Notification of that administrator  The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal, and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification. The appeal may not be processed otherwise. If a block is appealed, the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification.

That was not a personal attack. Don't come in the middle of a discussion just because one person decides to complain, if that happened at all. If you want to chase people away from editing Wikipedia, that's a good way to do it.

1) You have failed to explain what the quote does for the article besides trying to say """"Well, they're just theists, so why listen to them?"""" As I said before, the reasoning for keeping the quote would also allow us to find and add quotes along the lines of """"it must be considered that only atheists and those with a grudge against Christianity support this theory"""" - and I doubt that you would so whole-heartedly support such a quote, hmm?
2) Then where is this majority of scholars that are not historians?
Richard Burridge, Graham Gould, Van Voorst, Graham Stanton, R.T. France are heads of theology departments. I can not find whether they were taught in a divinity school, though.
Michael Grant is an atheist and a full-fledged historian.
James Frazer studied myth and religion in general.

An excerpt from online, detailing some of those who oppose the hypothesis:
""""Meier [Meie.MarJ, 23] notes that what we know about Alexander the Great could fit on only a few sheets of paper; yet no one doubts that Alexander existed. Charlesworth has written that """"Jesus did exist; and we know more about him than about almost any Palestinian Jew before 70 C.E."""" [Chars.JesJud, 168-9] Sanders [Sand.HistF, xiv] echoes Grant, saying that """"We know a lot about Jesus, vastly more than about John the Baptist, Theudas, Judas the Galilean, or any of the other figures whose names we have from approximately the same date and place."""" On the Crucifixion, Harvey writes: """"It would be no exaggeration to say that this event is better attested, and supported by a more impressive array of evidence, than any other event of comparable importance of which we have knowledge from the ancient world."""" [Harv.JesC, 11] Dunn [Dunn.EvJ, 29] provides an anecdote similar to the one above regarding Shakespeare. Referring to Wells' thesis, he writes:
 

    The alternative thesis is that within thirty years there had evolved such a coherent and consistent complex of traditions about a non-existent figure such as we have in the sources of the Gospels is just too implausible. It involves too many complex and speculative hypotheses, in contrast to the much simpler explanation that there was a Jesus who said and did more or less what the first three Gospels attribute to him. The fact of Christianity's beginnings and the character of its earliest tradition is such that we could only deny the existence of Jesus by hypothesizing the existence of some other figure who was a sufficient cause of Chrstianity's beginnings - another figure who on careful reflection would probably come out very like Jesus!

Finally, let's seal the coffin on consenus with these words from a hardened skeptic and an Emeritus Professor of History, Morton Smith [Hoff.JesH, 47-8] . Of Wells' work, this historian and skeptic of orthodox Christianity wrote:

""""I don't think the arguments in (Wells') book deserve detailed refutation.""""

""""...he argues mainly from silence.""""

""""...many (of his arguments) are incorrect, far too many to discuss in this space.""""
 

""""(Wells) presents us with a piece of private mythology that I find incredible beyond anything in the Gospels.""""

None of these scholars, we emphasize, are friends of fundamentalism or evangelical Christianity. Contrary to the protestations of the """"Jesus-myth"""" consortium, they make their statements based on evidence, not ideology. Conspiracy and bias exist only in their own imagination.

Again, the fact is is that the complaint isn't relevant. The mainstream historian position, which would hardly be mostly Christian, supports the claim that Jesus was a historical person. All that quote does is try to attack the speaker's instead of the evidence, and it would be blatantly dishonest to try to include it. Provide all the arguments for the claim that you want - but this isn't one of them. Koromon survived intact. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I know allegations of admin abuse require clear proof, but it may be below. See, I wouldn't mind so much if I knew what bad behavior I was doing. I have in good faith begged and pleaded for anyone, anyone with expertise or experience to explain what was blockable; please take the time to review considerately. At virtually every turn, when I requested a policy clarification as a 2-month user, if I even got a cite, it was only to a whole policy page, and never with a diff to my alleged offense. This behavior is so consistent from so many users that it is hard to explain, much less to provide sources for this possibly exceptional claim. But let's please start with what points I do get, and the questions I need answered first by you, the reviewer:
(N.b. I wrote this the first hour of block. I trustingly clicked Save and did not realize that there would be an edit conflict due to the edit warrior (below) closely following me and stating her block agreement """"sadly"""" (huh?) and giving nuanced advice and compliments (unhelpful). This minor frustration can be gotten past, but of course this request is now many hours late. PLEASE at least quickly indicate willingness to answer.)
See whole discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:POINT is intended to refer to my politely proposing a change to WP:V (my first policy suggestion) and disclosing what I regarded as an edit war about the issue. Instead of any comments on the merits (except one positive one), I received consistent criticism about my poor formatting followed by refusal to address the merits because (apparently) it was obviously unnecessary to answer. Q. When one has made a policy suggestion in good faith and one receives zero discussion on its negatives and significant negative discussion on one's person and presentation, is one refusing to get the point if one continues politely requesting the specific demerits of the proposal that would indicate nonconsensus on its merits?
See whole user discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:HAR (first I've heard of this charge against me) is intended to refer to my appropriate-level user warnings in response to an editor using obscenity and assuming bad faith this is only the most reasonable guess, of course. After he stated he was entitled to assume bad faith, he changed up and claimed facetiously he really was assuming good faith. My links there indicate specifically what behavior I referred to. I know of no other case which might come near to harassment. Q. When one uses edit warnings in full compliance with policy and is met with continuing bad faith, is one harassing?
See whole COI discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:DE is intended to refer primarily to my first extended correction of a user charging me with COI, along with a suggestion that the accusing user may also have COI. Certainly I might have been overstrong in that edit (I recognize not noticing the 200-word limit, but I adverted that myself). But again, there was no indication of why a donor to a political candidate has the sort of close relationship envisioned by COI. There was one attempt at googling me (and I'm not looking up the personal details policy right now) which turned up nothing undisclosed besides my blog comments but this was described as """"considerable involvement of ... promotional activities"""". Recall there are about 60,000 Ron Paul Meetup volunteers, and nearly that many donors. If I worked for a 60,000-member workplace there might be a bit more point, but even that would be debatable in good faith. Q. Is every political donor or Meetup member forbidden from editing candidate-related articles neutrally, or only those who willingly disclose the relationship?
As near as I can tell, there is a further potential application of WP:POINT (which by the way is an application of the rule, convenient to the generic, that a generic warning is fungible with any warning). Apparently I don't realize that, in some sense, these users are every one justified in refusing to explain specifically any of their adverse actions against me, and that I am being disruptively pointed if I explain specific charges against them, citing policy and diffs. And there I do admit not understanding. The policies are no Procrustean bed, but very specific. I am completely unfamiliar with operating in such an environment other than to do one's best to WP:AGF, to complain properly and carefully, and to accept potential suffering for it. However I'm essentially barred by generic threats (yes) from complaining specifically, and I'm completely certain that a generic, unsourced complaint from me (as appears to be the",0,0,0,0,0,0

                          The Colour out of Space      

I dreamed that I was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw; a yellow,hairy, five-clawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulfme. And when I stopped to reflect what the paw was, it seemed to me thatit was Egypt. - HP Lovecraft

This is only a test

At 5:05 on November 22, 1977, regular television programming in southern England was interrupted by a voice claiming to be that of """"Grahama,"""" representative of the """"Ashtar Galactic Command,"""" bearing the usual """"space brother"""" boilerplate of coming in peace to save us from ouselves at the dawn of a New Age. It was quickly dismissed as a hoax, but an extremely complicated one to execute. 

Though the The Sunday Times the following December 4 surmised it was accomplished by students using just """"£80 worth of equipment powered by an ordinary car battery,"""" no one ever claimed responsibility, and independent investigations found that the message must have cut into at least five transmitters simultaneously,and it evaded detection by monitoring equipment which did not even register an interruption, """"suggesting it was achieved in some way that by passed our electrical system.""""

This was actually the second message from Grahama. A month earlier, he had said pointedly that """"We conveyed to Sir John Whitmore and to Dr. Puharich that we would interfere on your radio and television communication systems to relay when the civilisations are coming close to landing on your planet Earth. It is now in motion. We wish you to know that we love you.""""

That """"Grahama"""" would single out the aristocratic former racing champion Whitmore and parapsychologist and MKULTRA researcher Andrija Puharich suggests this was no simple hoax: both men were deeply involved with a decades'-long channelled communication with entities representing a universal hierarchy sometimes called the """"70 Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood."""" The entities governing our reality identified themselves The Nine.

Another link to Whitmore and Puharich was British author Stuart Holyroyd's recently published Prelude to the Landing on Planet Earth, which the two had commissioned as an account of their work with the Nine. In the book, Holroyd wrote that the Nine intended to “interrupt televisionand radio transmissions during the period 18th to 22nd November.”

Regarding the television interruptions, Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince write in The Stargate Conspiracy that, """"as usual, there were only two options considered: either the wholething was genuine and extraterrestrials had really spoken to the southern English through their television sets; or it was hoax, just done for a laugh.The idea that such a message could be easily contrived by, for example, an intelligence agency that would have the necessary technical skills has never,to our knowledge, even been considered.""""

Of course there are several pages about me in that same book and I worked with Puharich for a short while.

This seems a bizarre oversight given the circumstantial connections to Whitmore and Puharich,and especially the latter's service in Army Intelligence and later as a CIA contractor researching the induction of altered states of consciousness.(Whitmore, incidentally, is now also Britain's """"number one business coach,"""" training top executives from companies such as Barclays, Lloyds, Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Rolls Royce.) Uri Geller,for a time one of the Nine's channellers, told Picknett and Prince that """"the CIA brought Puharich in to come and get me out of Israel,"""" and in his essay In the Thick of It, physicist Jack Sarfatti writes that """"Puharich was Geller's case officer in America with money provided by Sir John Whitmore.""""

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.",1,0,1,0,1,0

As alleged by the United States Probation Office, on or about October 1, 2002, defendant filed a motion in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Orange, case number A215011, in which he requested that his true legal name be changed from Nakoula Basseley Nakoula to Mark Basseley Youssef, and an order changing defendant's name to Mark Basseley Youssef was issued as a result of this motion.  Notwithstanding this fact, defendant represented to this Court in connection with his underlying criminal case that his true legal name was Nakoula Basseley Nakoula; to date, he has used the Nakoula identity on all documentation provided to this Court and to the Probation during the entirety of his term on supervised release; and he simultaneously possessed identification in this name, as well as the Youssef identity, while on supervised release, in violation of his conditions of supervised release.
... Chief Magistrate Judge Suzanne H. Segal ordered the government to file this request ... Accordingly, the government respectfully requests that future pleadings in this case be captioned to refer to defendant by his true legal name, Mark Basseley Youssef ...

I expect that in the next couple weeks, the major news media will follow the court's lead and switch to primarily referring to him as Youssef (while still frequently mentioning the Bacile and Nakoula aliases).

It would be nice to have a single page to discuss changes relating to all the Unicode chart templates.

The question is which capitalization is best.  It was me who originally added the character names and """"reserved"""", """"control"""" and """"not a character"""" annotations to the templates, taken from the Unicode Character Data file where character names are all upper case and """"reserved"""", """"control"""" and """"not a character"""" are all lower case. However, I don't see any reason not to capitalize """"reserved"""", """"control"""" and """"not a character"""" to """"Reserved"""", """"Control"""" and """"Not a character"""" on Wikipedia when used as titles.  You could also make a case for capitalizing character names rather than using all upper case (e.g. """"Latin Capital Letter A"""" or """"Latin capital letter A"""" instead of """"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A"""", but in very many cases it would be problematic to decide which words to capitalize and which not, so I would prefer to stick with all upper case character names.

Question of Mr. Ahmad Derwish; he has submitted this question by Mr. (name not visible), german nationality:

A man of muslim belief, egyptian nationality married a women of christian belief, german nationality.
In aggreement of the couple, the mentioned muslim converted to the christian religion and joined the christian creed.

1 - What is the islamic judgement about the person's status according to the islamic punishment?

2 - Are his childen understood as muslims or christians? What is the judgement?

The Answer:

God, Lord of the worlds is praised. God bless the man of the envoys, our Lord Muhammed, his family and all his fellows and give them  salvation.

Herewith we grant information: since he is dropped from the islam, he will be invited for regretfulness. Does he not regret, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the islamic law.

Referring to his children, so they are minor muslims. When they reach full age, and if they remain within the islam, they are muslims. If they leave the islam, they will be invited to regret. If they do not regret, they will be killed. God the almighty knows best.

At the moment, Danny, you are trying to turn this entire article into a Watchtower magazine, packed with misquoted scriptures and no discussion making any proven point that these scriptures are backing up JWs' doctrines. Just the usual dump a scripture and run routine, it's not acceptable Danny, you may think any form of propaganda is ok as your religion teaches that, but keep it in your own magazines, please don't infect a public domain with it (I'm sure this will fall on deaf ears).

You made another comment """"Either way, it isn't a point of view, but an indisputable fact that JWs use the Bible as the primary source of their doctrines and beliefs."""" Come on Danny, you know your comment is highly incorrect and very deceitful. Take a look at their predictions, where are they in the Bible, didn't Russell have a fetish for pyramids and made predictions based on their measurements? 

1. demonstrate where 1899, 1874, 1878, 1914, 1918, 1925, 1975 etc, are """"an indisputable fact that JWs use the Bible as the primary source of their doctrines and beliefs""""?
2. Or Where does the Bible divide 'major and minor' blood parts, and say one is ok, and the other a grave sin? I can't find that in my Bible, can you show me please? Or plasma is a sin, but breaking it down is ok, or that red blood cells are a sin to use, but using the 99% haemoglobin in them is ok? Or that animal blood is a sin, but processing cows blood into products is and using them is ok? You get the picture Danny, and there are pages and pages more that scholars agree have no basis in the Holy Bible are all. Please refrain from making silly emotional claims that will end up with egg on your face.

You say more: """"While many disagree with JW interpretation of the Bible, it is important that WP readers see how JWs use scriptures"""", except Danny, they do not see that, there are no justifying explanations, just a scriptures dropped in, and then run along to the next one before they have time to think. For each scripture, there should also be a link to a scholarly discussion that is contrary to JWs interpretation to give a rounded balance of coverage, if you oppose this, you have proven your motives are not pure, but agenda seeking for religious promotion, not balanced articles in a public domain, thus proving that these inserted scriptures are POV and should not be there. Why can't a belief just be """"they believe x, y, z.""""? You are not discussing scriptures and there is not room on Wikipedia for that, so why try and manipulate by dropping them in controversially, and then running away with no justification for they reference?  8th of September 2005

The J.D. is not a doctoral level degree. That someone chooses to call it that means nothing. There is at least one college that calls all of it B.S.-level alumnae """"doctor"""" because of some tradition, akin to the Italian use of Dottore. Everyone agreed that the old D.Pharm., before the recent changes, was a master's-level degree. When I see surveys of """"highest level of education completed"""" I often see the J.D. lumped with professional master's degrees like a M.Arch. (usually 2-3 years) or M.S.W. or the like. The D.C. was often lumped in there, but they're made an effort to get more people to have completed a B.S. first to raise their standing, as pharmacy is trying to do. As mentioned, in many fields the terminal degree is a master's, for example in many artistic fields (M.F.A.). I clearly recall arguments, reported in The Chronicle of Higher Ed., over whether a J.D. holder should be a university's president given the lack of a terminal/doctoral degree. I also point out that following a J.D. one still takes a master's or (higher) doctorate as the next step, if desired. In my experience, J.D. holders occasionally use """"Doctor"""" in very formal settings in academiaif speaking at a graduation ceremonybut for the most part, no. Certainly, I consider them to have a degree that is the equivalent of a 3-year M.Arch. Since there is no pre-law curriculum, it just isn't comparable  to a Ph.D. biologist who took a B.S. and M.S. in the same subject.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've been studying Satmar for a good bit, and I've been to Kiryas Joel. I've never heard it called """"Sakmer"""". Are we sure about this?  
I've been around many Hasidim for a long, long time too, and I have never heard of Sakmer either, so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed.  
there is a street in KJ called Sakmer

also: look at this http://tovrent.com/satmar/85.jpg

The reason some call it Sakmer is because the name Satmer is based on Satu Mare which remotely referes Saint Mary [NOTE - not true, Satu Mare means simply """"Large Village"""" in Romanian!]. Hassidic Jews have always refrained from sanctifying Christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been """"studying"""" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi """"The Rav of Sakmer"""". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: סאקמער. The third letter from the right carries the K sound. Cheers.

I recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor (great-grandfather?) of his called Satmar Sakmer. Why do they not utilize that term anymore? And, I'm done with my hardcore pshat study of different Hasidic groups.  

It's total nonsense, the 'saint mary' story. Satu Mare means 'large town'. My father has been there many times. Wikipedia (yes yes) also says that Satu Mare means 'large town', and that 'saint mary' is something else entirely in Hungarian/Romanian.  
I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing. 

About Satmar and NETUREI KARTA. THe Cherem bit is incorrect, as is the bit of a denunciation. Also the part of asking Reb Yoilish to meet with Yasser Arrafat. It's all myth. Yasser Arafat and the PLO were not the public face of the Palestinian cause before Reb Yoilish had his stroke, so it doesn't make sense. I actually asked a chaver of the Satmar Beis Din about the Cherem, and he said it's nonsense. The Beis DIn has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the United States. No denunciation was issued either. It's a made up propaganda piece by the Kakhnik radio station Arutz Sheva. It never happened. No such thing ever appeared in Der Yid, which is the official newspaper.

 Etymology 

with Satu coming from the same root as """"city"""" (civitas)

Actually, it's not like this. In Romanian, """"satu"""" is derived from Latin """"fossatum"""" and it originally meant a village encircled by a moat (in Latin """"fossa""""). """"Cetate"""" is the Romanian word derived from """"civitas"""".  | Talk

3ebbf778e08c7a31,"""::Nice wording there.  That's the point.  It's a fact.  It's not a """"portrayal"""" that is """"too positive"""".  It's a fucking FACT.  What planet is this?  Where does this argument come from?  IT IS A FACT.  It matters not what editors of this encyclopedia think.  It matters greatly what the sources state.  And they state it explicitly: """"Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all-time"""", """"By acclamation Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all-time"""".  How much more explicit do you expect it to get?  They aren't going to waltz the answer out to you.  This is an objective look at someone who demonstrably showed that they were the greatest.  If editing is a problem, then just create a special lock or something for the opening paragraph that only the top moderators can unlock.  Every source in existence acknowledges him as #1 all-time.  So the idea of """"having certain wording"""" that may not object to certain users' opinions completely defeats the purpose of an ENCYCLOPEDIA.

All artists had cited sources refering to there signed status on The Black Wall Street Records, I suggest you revert this edit yourself as you have deleted the information for the reason """"artists with no body of work"""". There are related pages for one artist, and the other two are to be made.

This R.I. switch thing could potentially make the Voting history table a mess if a switched person is added in ever time.  I think the table should only include actual TC votes or medical removal/quits.  Similarly, the  should only be done when Jeff initiates a switch and the switch is forced.

And if Jannetty is left off, then i think Gangrel should be true. rumors said he was overweight and WWE was considering not using him

Angel Williams has been called up to valet the Gymini. she did so for a dark match, should she be called up to SD! yet?

And I have made sure not to do that, as pointed out above. I must once again point out, though, that it is not merely their """"poor understanding of the English language,"""" when even The American Heritage Dictionary and the Wikipedia Meat article separates fish from meat. But, anyway, a pescetarian is a type of vegetarian, as valid sources state. The lead does not directly call pescetarians vegetarians (due to dispute), but only presents that, in some authoritive dictionaries, vegetarianism may include the consumption of fish. As stated before, the lead then makes sure to tie that type of diet to pescetarianism, and note how pescetarianism being thought of as vegetarianism is disputed. Merriam-Webster even now defines pescetarianism  as """"vegetarians who eat fish"""" (as I've already mentioned)...so, clearly, there is validity in mentioning pescetarianism as being an aspect of vegetarianism (as much as veganism is), especially as long we note the dispute between the two terms, and especially when pescetarianism is present within the body of this article, below the lead.

when the USSR invaded and brutally subjugated the Baltics it was not an Ally. That it was an Ally later is completely irrelevant to the situation in the Baltics and any other territories where the USSR was the initial aggressor, and you know that. (I also point out that you use later, not original, relationships to tar others but use the same to your benefit when it's good for Stalin.)
 If you wish to demonstrate some semblance of objectivity, I suggest you:
 retract your contentions of """"semi-voluntary"""" cooperation by the Baltic peoples with Nazis based on gratitude that Hitler considered them """"semi-Aryan"""" and not semi-Simian
 affirm that as far as you are concerned, the only reason Latvians et al. fought against an """"Ally"""" is because that """"Ally"""" was re-invading their homeland, and that fighting that """"Ally"""" had nothing to do whatsoever with the expression of sympathies for the Nazi cause.
 Absent of these two actions on your part, I cannot consider your presence here and participation in this conversation in particular as being in anything resembling good faith.
 Regarding Poland, let's see, 51% of territory to Stalin, 49% of territory to Hitler = Stalin wound up with more of Poland than Hitler. So, your personal attack that I'm lying is, unfortunately, a lie.
 As for your contention that Stalin """"saved"""" Jews, with respect to the Baltics at least, Jews were deported to Siberia by the USSR in a greater proportion of population than any other ethnic group and to harsher conditions, as Stalin was a rabid anti-Semite. Your history is flawed there as well. That some Jews escaped owing to circumstance had nothing to do with Stalin being beneficent to Jews, he plainly was not.  ►TALK

Please sign posts, folks.  I'm sure the Jones link will be scrubbed.  That said, if you're looking for humor, I'd say it was hilarious when Rothschild claimed Jupiter was closer to the sun than earth.  It was also hilarious when Jones said """"Take me lord Rothschild, take me!"""" in immitation of a woman being impressed at Rothschilds self-given title of """"adventurer"""".  Also, Jones never accused David Mayer de Rothschild personally of being the head of a neo-feudal empire, he did however infer that his family was involved with such.  Rothschild repeatedly accused Jones of being an oil baron, which is absurd and ironic considering the Rothschild investments in big oil.  Anyway, if we're to believe David de Rothschild's book, then the solution to global warming is to wear sweaters, ride in electric geo metros packed like clown cars, and build straw houses.  If anyone can show me a Rothschild (of the actual European banking line) that doesn't live in a castle and instead lives in a straw house, I will actually waste money on this chap's silly, insulting book.  I wonder how many beautiful trees are now dead because David de Rothschild wanted to publish this book.  As for Rothschild's demeanor, of course he was somewhat calm, it's part of the training.  The best liars are always calm because they have gone to schools where that selling point technique is taught.  It's called public relations, and it only works on dullards in my opinion.

 Comments on the block
 It is a complaint and I have the rightly described the nature of edits being done by these two editors.Blocking me gives a wrong signal to them and probably will encourage such concerted POV pushing.
 I have already mentioned somewhere that the organisations supported by these editors have been mentioned as having fascist tendencies by world media.They cant deny that.
 Some examples against whites from User: Bose.
""""There is no shortage of hindu-haters among white scholars, or their pinko moonbat lackeys in India. Surely some hindu-hater like Wendy Doniger, Deepa Mehta or Arundhati Roy has a copy of the film on their website. Find it. Then put it up."""" 
 """"The world outside the US is irrelevant""""
 Read the para """"Human Rights Watch has been criticized as a fraud"""" in .See how the edits end.""""The world outside the US is less relevant""""

 My mention of them as US government lawyer and (not Wikipedia's) was their attitude in the article.No comment below is racist in character.This is a false charge and the user who has made that should be blocked.Secondly, they insist on pushing some comments from Daniel Pipes (who is widely known for his Pro-Jewish POV leanings)

The complete thread of that discussion is mentioned below 
 Refrain from inserting original research that is irrelevant to the Babri Mosque article. Plus, the section on Pipes you inserted is tantamount to a character assassination of well-respected and US government appointed political scholar Daniel Pipes. Further perpetration of such a deed is grounds for reporting.Netaji  
Reporting as legal??TerryJ-Ho 
Is Wikipedia a US government property and you their lawyer? I have taken cue from you .In fact, I have been everyone as Anti-Hindu.TerryJ-Ho

Sorry for not getting back sooner, and in fact I will for now address only one of our ongoing topics because I have a lot going on currently.

1. Technical problem: the brackets appear around the Radical Party.
2. Lots of red links. For now, I think I'd prefer de-linking them until we have articles.
3. Fitting some of the parties into categories, particularly the more obscure ones, and the ones that clearly might belong to two–the Ploughmen's Front, the German Party, etc. I will need help with this.
4. With reference to both the categories and individual parties, should they be in a particular order?

There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting.

Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT.

We know meatpuppets are using various fake IPs to add false material and to removal of factual material. In one of many recent disgusting edits by meatpuppet/s, Ryan was accused of having sexual relations with his own daughter. In another disgusting edit Ryan was accused of being born a homosexual. Ryan is dead but his family members are alive to take legal action against these meatpuppets. 

Ryan’s surviving members of his family will continue to correct the distorted, manipulated opinions and views of one book author Mike Richards, whilst all other referenced material is ignored, vandalized and removed. The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. 

Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot. 

To put it bluntly, the meatpuppets refuse to allow any contributions on the facts of the Ryan case. Their hatred for Ryan is rather sick and disturbing to say the least.

Original article should be like this

 

Franjo Tuðman (May 14, 1922 - [[December
9]], 1999) was the first president of Croatia in
the 1990s.

Tuðman's political party HDZ (Hrvatska Demokratska
Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union) won the first
post-communist multi-party elections in 1990 and
he became the president of the country. A year later he
proclaimed the Croatian declaration of independence. He
was reelected twice and remained in power until his death
in late 1999. In English, his surname is spelled
""""Tudjman"""".

The Communist

Franjo Tuðman was born in Veliko Trgovišæe, a village in
the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia.

During WWII Tuðman fought on the side of
Tito's partisans, where he
also met his future wife, Ankica. He became one of the
youngest generals in the Yugoslav People's Army in the
1960s — a fact which some observers linked to the
fact that he sprung from Zagorje, a region that gave few
Communist partisans.

Others have observed that Tuðman was probably the most
educated of Tito's generals (as regards military history,
strategy and the interplay of politics and warfare)
— this claim is supported by the fact that
generations of future Yugoslav generals based their
general exam theses on his voluminous book on guerilla
warfare throughout history: Rat protiv rata (""""War
against war""""), 1957, which covers topics as diverse as
Hannibal's drive across the Alps, the Spanish war
against Napoleon and Yugoslav partisan
warfare.

Tuðman left active army service in 1961 to found the
Institut za historiju radnièkoga pokreta Hrvatske
(""""Institute for the History of Croatia's Workers'
Movement""""), and remained its director until 1967.

The Dissident

Apart from the book on guerilla warfare, Tuðman wrote a
series of articles  attacking the Yugoslav
Communist establishment, and was
subsequently expelled from the Party. His most important
book from that period was Velike ideje i mali narodi
(""""Great ideas and small peoples""""), a monograph on
political history that collided with central dogmas of
Yugoslav Communist elite with regard to the
interconnectedness of the national and social elements in
the Yugoslav revolutionary war (during [[World War
II|WWII]]).

In 1971 he was sentenced to two years of prison for
alleged subversive activities during the so-called
""""Croatian Spring"""".

The Croatian Spring was a reformist movement that was
actually set in motion by Tito and Croatian party
chief Bakariæ in the climate of
growing liberalism in the late 60s. It was initially a
tepid and ideologically controlled party liberalism, but
it soon grew into mass manifestation of dissatisfaction
with the position of the Croatian people in
Yugoslavia, and it began to threaten the party's
political monopoly. The result was a brutal suppression by
Tito, who used the military and the police to crush
what he saw as the threat to his undivided power - Bakariæ
quickly distanced himself from the Croatian Communist
leadership that he himself helped gain power earlier, and
sided with the Yugoslav ruler.

During the turbulent 1971, Tuðman's role was that of the
dissident who questioned the central myth of modern
Serbian nationalism, the number of victims of
the Jasenovac concentration camp, as well as the role
of centralism in Yugoslav and the continuation of
ideology of unitary """"Yugoslavism"""". Tuðman felt that this
originally Croatian romantic pan-Slavic idea from the
19th century had been mutated in harsh realities in both
Yugoslav states into the front for a pan-Serbian drive for
domination over non-Serb peoples — from economy and

For example, if a small country suddenly gets a high influx of highly intelligent immigrants, suddenly more than 50% of the population would have an IQ of 100 or higher. But instead of changing the normal distribution, the next time when they standardize the IQ-test, they take a representative sample of 1000 or 10,000 inhabitants, and the ones that have an average intelligence get IQ 100, the 2% most intelligent people get IQ 130 or more; the 2% least intelligent people get IQ 70 or less.

 B Kobres concedes work of Dr. Rex Curry http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html 

B Kobres has conceded the historical discoveries of Dr. Rex Curry concerning symbolism under the horrid National Socialist German Workers' Party. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html  Even after conceding that the information could not be disputed, B Kobres nevertheless indicated his desire to suppress the information in order to maintain the intellectual errors that Kobres has mistakenly perpetuated in his past.

Wikilings do their dirty work anonymously, hiding behind names that do not identify them because they are ashamed to admit who they are and what they do. The practice is so widespread on wikipedia that people like Kobres have inspired and acquired the term """"wikilings"""" and """"wikiling writers"""" as a reference to their bad behavior.  B Kobres deletes valid responses to the personal attacks and kookiness of himself and other """"wikilings""""; but, B Kobres does not delete the personal attacks and kookiness of other wikilings who write with him.

They delete accurate information that is posted on “discussion” pages, which are supposedly for discussion, but are not. Discussion pages are where wikilings insult people and then delete responses to the insults.

Kosovo is the drug-trading hot-spot, and so is Albania. Half of the population of Albania are still farmers, using tools that were used centuries ago. Albania has a large gray economy that may be as large as 50% of official GDP. Now, as far as wars are concerned, Albanians have, only in the last 15 years, started three, one in Kosovo, one in South Serbia (Presevo Valley), and one in Macedonia. All were wars of secession, wherever they go, they want to separate. This is not propaganda, this is fact, and anyone in the world can check it. Comparing to Serbia's percentage of 96% who can read and write, Albania's percentage of 86% sounds low. I have never heard, in my 16 years of living in Serbia, that Albanians have tails, I'm affraid you made that up. Furthermore, the Greater Albania concept still lives in Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia and Greece, while the """"Greater Serbia"""" dream has faded away long ago.

Inquirer.net is a reliable resource but the particular Inquirer.net article that you used as reference never mentioned that the Ang Dating Doon segment is a parody of Ang Dating Daan. In fact, the name of the program Ang Dating Daan cannot be found anywhere on that Inquirer.net article. Therefore, it does not qualify as reference, not because Inquirer.net is not reliable, but because the idea that you're trying to convey is not supported by the article. Dar book, it is actually you who is bellittling Philippine-related articles by your reckless and uneducated editing. If you truly value Philippine-related articles then you should be extra careful not to destroy their quality and credibility. Also, since you are editing the Tagalog Wikipedia, may I suggest that you begin creating a Tagalog version of the English WP articles on Eli soriano and Ang Dating Daan? If you don't do it, someone else is going to do it sooner or later. The information on the different language versions of WP must match (or at least approximate) the best and most comprehensive article, which in the case of Eli Soriano and Ang Dating Daan happens to be the English version. –   20:23",0,0,0,0,0,0

b3abb55edfe85dbb,"Sinhalese Nagas 
It is very much founding fact that Sinhalese were unification of hela groups and sinha. Also it is very much famous fact that there were 4 hela groups in the island. Origins of the Hela Race. Hela was combination of Raksha, Yaksha, Deva, Naga. 

Raksha were extreamly powerful in the history but may be lost power due to battles,.. At the time of start writing the history, Raksha and Deva wasn't powerful. Naga was the most powerful authorities. That time only they had kingdoms. It is evident that they ruled two kingdoms Kelaniya and Jaffna. Others lived as small groups ( kuveni's story). 

Rajarata area was ruled by Yakshas before Vijaya. After 2,3 generations from Pandukabhaya, kings tend to suffix 'Tissa' and 'Naga' to their names. Tissa name is comes from Sinha tribe. There is no reason they added Naga to their names other than representing Naga tribe. This says later Naga royal families in one of the 2 kingdoms ( most probably Nagadeepa) made connections to the royal family in Rajarata. Nagas came to Anuradhapura and joined the Sinhas and Yakshas and actually able to dominate over others. So kingdom of Nagadeepa was lost from the history and Rajarata was trying to gain Naga/Sinha identity in which there had been a Yaksha rule. But kelaniya was there and ruled as maya rata.  

It is also very much evident Naga were the dominant tribe withing the core of the kingdom to protect their king. Those days without having clear power king can't survive. Yaksha's had clear control of Rajarata during the period of Pandukabhaya. But later Naga influence of the kingdom started to growth due to connection between royal families. Since conflicts between tribes hasn't been ended, Naga/Sinha king wasn't be a fool to rule middle of Yaksha on those days. Also we can see there is a clear discrimination against yakshas and had introduced a superiority on Nagas defining solosmasthana. Also some Yakshas leave the Rajarata and come other areas. Ritigal Jayasena was one of them.

So Nagas dominated over Rajarata and Maya rata but still others may had the control in Malaya rata and Ruhuna. SL was unified on tribe basis. After SL was converted to buddhism it wasn't required to unify tribes which based on religion. Since Ruhuna also accepted Buddhism (due to fear for Asoka) Rajarata king could made his brother ( MahaNaga) as the king of Ruhuna without considerable resistance. So it is very much evident that Sinhalese mainly consist of Nagas.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Historically, testicle cuffs may have been used by the slave traders of Western Africa, as a means to subdue newly-captured males.

The testicle cuffs extended between the legs, and each man was connected to the next by a rope between their genitals. These tight metal bindings on their scrotums were to ensure that a quick pace was kept, for if a man were to stop walking the rope would pull and cause quick, sharp pain in the genital region. doesn't sound vaguely historical, source it or I'll remove it.",0,0,0,0,0,0

2. now i dont have a mother(or parents for that matter) but i know where you are getting at: dont try to hurt other peoples feelings or as you may put it or potty it ;)  dont be a potty mouth
3. ( now this is the part Travian has a little problem with i feel that you should have been a wee bit more lenient with me on my first block(not this one) you should have warned me before blocking since it was my first time anyway but i guess blocking all those other vandals has some kind of a PTSD effect on wiki admins dont worry ill make the explanation short  please tolerate Travian he only made 4 reverts he was warned ONLY once for reverting 3 times and at that time he didnt check his talk page so he didnt know if he had a warning as he was busy browsing but that wasnt a violation it was a fair warning no doubt but... at that exact time i was going to modify my 4th edit(it was not a revert) so naturally i wouldnt be able to see the warning i only saw the orange message after i finished editing and saved the page after i did that i got another warning only it wasnt a warning it said that i have been reported for editting 4 times boy did i wish it was a warning though P now i felt that i deserved a warning before i got blocked a warning by YOU yourself we are all guys here arent we (even though im 12 i still do count D ) my point is we are all reasonable men here i would have stopped had i known that i was doing harm and not the good i envisioned. so please i would like to ask you tolerate me of you will ill talk more about this below
4. oh i humbly apologize but its just that that situation was unique that particular user wasnt going to listen anyway but believe me another user spoke to him giving a link to disprove his point but he kept insisting he was right i assumed good faith in that had he seen that link he would not have continued with his points (as he had been reverted by many others before too) but i was clearly wrong on that part so i reverted his edits and he kept reverting mine so i posted a comment on his talk page only to get insulted. i would have welcomed him with the """"welcome to wikipedia"""" thingy with the pretty pictures but alas i had no knowledge of how to do that. but i did make a little mistake though that comment i made may have been a bit personal but it was not an attack no was it insulting but it was accurate notheless and when he insulted me back i thought of ignoring him but knowing that he could easily be aggravated i just couldn't pass this offer up just for the giggles but i know when im guilty regardless of  reason if you may ask why i did it i would answer with IDIFTL D

 [edit conflict]

 Some good points, which require more thought.  Some initial responses: 
 I don't think """"Ukraine in WWI"""" is suitable, because most of the activity discussed in the article wasn't directly concerned with the war, and the period covered doesn't correspond to the duration of WWI (1914–1918). 
 """"Ukraine after the collapse of the Russian Empire"""" would be better, but it only defines the period in question by what it followed. In contrast, """"in the Russian Revolution"""" is associated with the events covered herein.
 I agree that """"History of Ukraine (1917-1922)"""" is the most neutral, but that is simply because it avoids saying what the article is about. I think readers appreciate being given a clue to the subject of an article when they see the title in isolation.  It would also be good to have a title which can at least occasionally be linked directly, rather than always having to type a piped link: [[History of Ukraine (1917-1922) |Ukraine in the Russian Revolution]].

 The first revolution of 1917 is what starts the events here, and Russian Revolution or Russian Civil War can refer to the greater events up to 1921.  I also think this article requires an earlier section covering events from the 1905 Revolution, but that will take a bit of reading first.

 Is it a problem to associate a Ukrainian history article with the Russian revolution in the title?  Personally, I think it's neutral because it doesn't imply that Ukraine was Russian, but merely refers to the defunct Russian Empire.

 But as I wrote above, you make some good points.  I'd like to get some more input from other editors. — Z. 2006-10-30 03:34 Z""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Ward Churchill is Not An Indian 
I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all """"Eichmann's."""" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 PLEASE READ BEFORE ADDING ANY MORE RUBBISH 

As far as I can see Wikipedia has become a very turgid shadow of what I originally signed up to - and I really can't see any point editing it any more.

Having followed the climate articles for many years and now having a great deal of expertise, I can no longer just sit back and hope that Wikipedia will some day come around to a NPOV. There are certain simple things that are so obviously POV pushing that it beggars belief that they still go on: 

Not using common names when they are used by everyone else
Not admitting simple facts like it is not currently warming.
Pretending """"global warming"""" is a """"scientific"""" issue when everyone knows it is mainly political rhetoric even when practised by the """"scientists"""".

And don't you dare think I'm pushing POV - I have not once added anything to a climate article without first seeking consensus (which basically means I have never edited a climate article)!!!!

I KNOW WHAT IS A NPOV ... BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I USED TO BE A GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATE AND NEITHER HAVE MY VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED ... I JUST CAN'T STAND PEOPLE BEING DISHONEST, AND I JUST THINK SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

From the day I first tried to get a NPOV on the climate articles (when I used to work in wind and was openly saying global warming is happening) till today, I haven't once managed to get a substantial change toward NPOV into a climate article. '''I'm angry ... not because I f*cking wanted to put the sceptical view ... it is because you bunch of pr***s have turned me into a sceptic because you refuse to see the obvious POV pushing that has been going on.

And the great consolation, is that the climate articles have been so POV that most decent people can spot it a mile off and what with climategate, the propaganda in Wikipedia is no longer considered a reliable source.   """,0,0,1,0,1,0

 Lesbian and Dyke (slang) articles  

Hello, Lionhead99. If you have checked the edit history of the Lesbian article before, which I believe that you have, you will see that your edits were reverted twice at that article, once by , with me elaborating on Wikiwind's revert for why your edits were reverted, and now by me. Those edit summaries clearly explain why you were reverted. Waiting a month later to restore most of it does not change the issue with your edit. It's not like most people who were watching an article stop watching it a month later and aren't going to notice what is mostly the same change that they objected to before. 

As I've stated, the lead isn't saying that being lesbian is a choice; it's saying whether or not to identify as lesbian is a choice; sexual identity is not always the same as sexual orientation, which I explained to a different person in September of this year on the Lesbian talk page. Your edits, among other things, removed material that addresses the important ways that the term """"lesbian"""" is used, material that is partly a summary of the Sexuality and lesbian identity section. Per WP:LEAD, the lead is supposed to """"summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies."""" Partially because """"lesbian"""" is often not consistently defined in the same way by women who use the term to describe their sexuality, it often is not consistently defined in the same way by researchers (see page 22). The Lesbian article is a big article; so it, of course, makes sense that its lead is four paragraphs, which is the advised limit for the lead. Leads may or may not include sources, as what is in the lead should be sourced in the lower body of the article and since sourcing the lead is a case-by-case matter. See Wikipedia:Lead#Citations. And WP:OVERLINKING is not good.

It should also help that  changed the """"About""""/disambiguation tag to identify that this article is not just about sexual orientation: """"This article is about the term Lesbian and female homosexuality. For the sexual orientation in general, see Homosexuality.""""

I also reverted you at the Dyke (slang) article, because, """"The term is not always pejorative anymore, as the lead notes. 'Dyke' is used very often among gay and bisexual-identified women without negative connotation. 'Sissy' or 'faggot' not as much to the same extent by gay men.""""   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

As I've already said, there was a similar drop in Putin's popularity before the 2004 elections, so that's not a new story. Reflecting in the lead every up and down in Putin's ratings is a heavy WP:RECENTISM and WP:Undue weight. Also, as was already said in the discussions above, there are different explanations to the booing story - reflecting them all means putting too much weight to this trivial event, while not reflecting them means non-neutral coverage. At the same event Putin was applauded, and it is not clear who was the person the booing was directed at. It's a sign of bias and yellow press style, and it's quite a pity that BBC and likes put so much attention to this episode. Note that Putin's popularity started decline before that event, and while I don't know the latest opinion polls, it is clear that if the popularity goes up that would be against the theory that that episode was somehow significant, while if the popularity goes down, that would be likely connected to the elections story rather than to some trivial episodes.

Thanks for your intervention on this page.  I agree you're probably right to remove the lengthy footnote, but my reason for supporting your removal of the reference would be different, namely that as time goes by some information loses its topical interest and becomes more abstruse (which is, I imagine, the reason it was placed in a footnote and not in the body of the text in the first place).

A few points however:
You have left some external links (Blair, Kelly) which had relevance to the detailed former footnote but not to the article.
There is a balance between referencing all statements and introducing clutter.  
The bullet-point statements are accurate (and, in point of fact can be verified easily enough by looking at the linked pages).  And as to technology, if you have a way to put a reference on a footnote using the edit pages, then you are a lot cleverer than I am.
Your criticism is a little disparaging.  It may of course be both accurate and justified, but pejorative language such as yours is quite difficult to read with a constructive attitude.  Perhaps it needs charity?  May I suggest that for the sake of the average grump you adopt the style of academia (which I admire but am no part of), which is to achieve a result coming up with an improvement rather than a half-baked detraction?",0,0,0,0,0,0

Alyx's injuries
I've noticed a tendency to describe Alyx as """"fatally wounded"""" and """"mortally wounded"""" by the hunter in Episode 2. She is neither, as those two terms are used to describe injuries resulting in death, and Alyx does not die. To say she is gravely wounded is the accurate term, or seriously wounded if someone really wants to play letter of the law with NPOV. I played the game again recently and no one on screen makes any reference to Alyx actually being dead and brought back to life, at least not as a result of the hunter incident. She is described as being near death, that's all.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I removed the statement. For one thing, the """"capitale nationale"""" as a nickname is dubious (it's more of a description).

Dear Bharatiyaji,

What is your view on where Vedas, Mahabharata and the Ashtadhyayi were composed? Can you briefly mention your views and if possible give us some references, so that we can examine them?

It is the view of the prominent scholars that these were indeed composed in the Punjab region. When I say 'Punjab region' I don't necessarily mean the Indian state of Punjab, which is just a small part of former Punjab.

Internal evidence from these books leads us to the same conclusion that they they were indeed composed in this region.

It is wrong because the section of the Manual of Style on section headings explicitly says (in the last bullet point):
""""If there are no blank lines above the heading, one line should be added, for readability in the edit window."""" [emphasis mine]
Your continual removal of this blank line appears to be based on a misinterpretation of the Headings and sections section of the Manual of Style page on Layout, which states:
""""Between sections, there should be only a single blank line; multiple blank lines in the edit window create too much white space in the article.""""
It is obvious from both the previous quotation and last sentence of this one that the instruction """"there should only be a single blank line"""" is referring to the layout in the edit window and not that of the finally rendered page.
It is not at all obvious to me that the aircraft specification template is broken. The bug which produces the extra newline could well be in the rendering software rather than the template itself.

 revision to chart 

I know it can be written that he was safe every week but go around to all the AI contenstant charts and you see the result of every week in the chart.   
Yea and they all should be changed. Just as we don't beat the obvious into people we don't need to state ___ has again gone another week. The info of what order they sang is also unhelpful. The lede clearly states he finished as the runner-up and we can give credit to our readers that they will realize that he didn't just sing those songs as a special guest. I'm not going to delete on all those other AI articles but I believe that should happen.   Banjeboi 
 So you think if someone wants to know if a contestant was safe they can go the American Idol season page?   
The chart is a supplement to the text which should be clear. The lede should state as of April 2009 ____ is a contestant. And when eliminated it states that info. Likewise with bottom three info, if it's relevant it will be in a reliable source - and OMG every bit of this stuff is covered - so we then cover it. _____ has never been in the bottom three or ____ has been in the bootom three twice before elimiation, etc. The order they sang? That seems likes it's original research or, sorry to say, fancruft, but not helpful on the biography articles. We have no reliable sourcing that the order impacts anything although it might. It ends up being as trivial as what they wore, their hair, who the friends were in the audience etc. If any of it is covered in reliable sources then maybe.

 I am somewhat confused by your statement that Astynax continues to promote Landmark as a religion. First, the use of the word """"promote"""" is almost exclusively used in what would be considered a """"positive"""" sense, and Landmark among others does not think of itself as a religion, so that description isn't necessarily """"positive."""" Also, as I think can be seen, the Human potential movement which Landmark is generally a part of is counted as a new religious movement, whose name strongly implies """"religious"""" nature but only implicitly, and in fact est is listed in the List of new religious movements I helped put together based on the articles contained in encyclopedic sources on NRMs I found. So there is in my eyes no real reason for really questioning est's inclusion as a NRM. In response to  if you have any sources available to help improve the article, or which might be useful in determining which article we should use as the primary article on this topic area, any input would be more than welcome. So far as I can tell, Landmark has pretty much said that they were initially using the est approach, although they have admitted to changing it subsequently (I'm not sure how much, or if they've ever specifically indicated in what ways). So it might be that something like Landmark Forum or some similar title might be the best main article for the topic of the seminars as a whole, with specific information on the various groups and companies related to it in articles on those topics. Maybe. This is a bit of an active controversy around here, and the topic area has recently been reviewed by ArbCom because of its contentiousness, but if you have any sources availableor other input which you think might be useful we would all welcome seeing them.

 Reply to your message about style issues and footnotes/references 

Hi! Just so you know, Template:cite news is the preferred way to cite news sources. Using the template allows us to easily modify references and easily keep all references in the same format. When editing a reference, please do not remove Template:cite news, as you did here. Also, there's no need to name references unless they're used more than once. Thank you.My way of including all references in an article is according to what I've found here and here that's close to the APA style. We are talking about footnotes that are references/citations to sources, right? Was not aware that a specific way to cite only the news, although it's a reference like any other printed source. 

Also, the reference was used twice, with the long version added at the first footnote (for example, such as this reference), and the shortened version used for subsequent mentions of the same citation (for example, such as in this case). If it matters that much for the sake of style and consistency, go ahead and change the format to one for news articles.

d1e48a1a3ea39675,"Wording and Clarification, + lack of source 

I have two changes that I suggest for the article:

'Parapsychology involves research that does not rely upon scientific modeling'.

This is an unsourced statement, and is a fairly bold statement to make. Whilst it may be true, I would suggest a source be found with examples of said methodological flaws, otherwise it should be removed.

'Critics such as Ray Hyman suggest that parapsychology has no methodological flaws that can explain apparently the successful experimental results that parapsychologists attribute to paranormal explanations, and various critics have classed the field as pseudoscience.'

Now this seems to be intended to be against parapsychology, yet the passage reads that there are no methodological flaws that can explain the results. Given that most attacks on parapsychology are aimed at exposing results as fake or due to methodological issues, this doesn't make sense.

Additionally, 'apparently the successful experimental results' does not read well. If this is intended to be a criticism, then perhaps it should be phrased 'the apparently successful experimental results'.

Finally 'various critics have classed the field as pseudoscience'. I do not have as much of an issue with this, yet the sources given include Hyman and Wiseman, both noted skeptics. Whilst their credentials are solid, the later part of the section names them as independent researchers, which is open to debate given their a priori stance that psychic phenomena do not exist.

{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be """"an editor of astrotheology"""" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more """"egregious misintrepretations."""" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren't all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. Why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? The computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why I got blocked before. After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don't you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her """"vanish"""" forever bit. I simply did not reply to her, (Comment redacted by   ) You can argue all you want that I changed the section title, which policy does allow for neutral view, (Comments redacted by   ) When ArbCom said this is obvious, I truly don't think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help  offer to help mediate. I saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides PastorDavid's. However, I sent an e-mail to ask her """"why... why.. why..""""... but now she is calling it """"obscene,"""" and offers to show it to any admin.

 Category Junk 

Mae West was many things, but there are some inappropriate categories listed.

1. Listing West as an """"erotic dancer"""" needs some justification, including within the article itself.  Other than performing a notable """"shimmy"""" at the beginning of her career, she isn't known for this, and the article doesn't mention any other instances.  In that case, she is no more an erotic dancer than Elvis Presley or Liza Minelli, maybe less so than Marlee Matlin now  none of whom are listed as erotic dancers.

2. """"Nymphomania"""" redirects to hypersexuality, which states, """"The consensus among those who consider this a disorder is that the threshold is met when the behavior causes distress or impaired social functioning.""""  Even the first line of the article uses the description """"debilitating"""".  West's sexual activity did not and was not.  Like other sex symbols of popular culture (e.g., Clara Bow, and you can probably think of some others), West was promiscuous and had a huge libido.  But they chose an industry and a role where those are NOT debilitating.

We-the undersigned, representing the hundreds of millions of other vandals and trolls, have conferred and agree that Wikipedia shall be given an opportunity to end this war.

The prodigious land, sea and air forces of the undersigned, many times reinforced by their armies and air fleets from the west, are poised to strike the final blows upon Wikipedia. This military power is sustained and inspired by the determination of all the Allied Vandals to prosecute the war against Wikipedia until she ceases to resist.

The result of the futile and senseless Chanting Fox resistance to the might of the aroused free peoples of the world stands forth in awful clarity as an example to the people of Wikipedia. The might that now converges on Japan is immeasurably greater than that which, when applied to the resisting Nazis, necessarily laid waste to the lands, the industry and the method of life of Chanting Fox and Lucky 6.9. The full application of our military power, backed by our resolve, will mean the inevitable and complete destruction of Wikipedia and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Wiki Foundation.
The time has come for Wikipedia to decide whether she will continue to be controlled by those self-willed militaristic advisers (e.g. JpGordon, Durvova, J.Delanoy, jdforrester, Sandstein, OrgangeMike, BigDunc, Alison, RodhullandEmu) whose unintelligent calculations have brought the Wikipedia Foundation to the threshold of annihilation, or whether she will follow the path of reason.

Following are our terms. We will not deviate from them. There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay.

There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the editors of Wikipedia into embarking on world conquest, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.
Until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that Wikipedia’s war-making power is destroyed, pages in article space to be designated by the Allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.

Wikipedia sovereignty shall be limited to the articles of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.
The Wikipedia military forces, after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.

We do not intend that the admins shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon us through abuse of their blocking, checkusering, and protection tools. The Wikipedia Foundation shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies amongst Wikipedians. 

Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be abolished in favour of whatever is lulziest.
Wikipedia shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Eventual Wikipedian participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.

The occupying forces of the Vandals shall be withdrawn from Wikipedia as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Vandals a lulzily inclined and irresponsible government.

We call upon Jimbo Wales to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Wikipedian armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Wikipedia is prompt and utter destruction.

 Hi — Love to help out with DoubIndemn 

Yeah, it's a drag there isn't a line of people wanting to help out with this great picture. I don't understand it; a whole lot of lesser pictures have crowds all bumping each other, wanting to edit.

My first comment to my (brand-new) collaborator is that your intro rewrite struck me as being a tad too beefy.

If  thinks that two wrongs always must make a right, he has the right to do so. But it takes all credibility out of Wikipedia to keep use incorrect sources only because they in turn copy the same mistake over and over and over and over. The system with Swedish military designations are not exclusive to aircraft or engines and have been the same since long before there were aircraft. This goes back to at least the 19th century, probably more. This is something I became aware of long time ago after spending hours digging in archives doing researches for numerous books and magazine articles about Swedish aviation history over the years. Why do you think it's SK 60 and not SK60 in the aricle(or even worse the Americanized SK-60)? The designation system is the same for Army bases, Air Force bases, Navy bases, radar, cameras, robots, airplanes, vehicles, guns, actually anything that goes into an inventory list including engines both piston and jets! Military systems anywhere are not exactly known for being flexible. Everything should be conformed the same. It should be the same with Wikipedia. If we want to spell the engine designation incorrect, then the airplane designation has to be changed to the incorrect """"SK60"""" as well! This goes for all other SAAB aircraft articles in all languages on Wikipedia! It has to be either, we can't have both! Personally I think it's easier to change a few incorrect spellings than hundreds that are already correct! After all, this is about common sense!! 

Also remember that a commercial website is often made by a webmaster who doesn't really know anything about the subject. This is not only true about Volvo Aero's web, but also the Swedish Armed Forces website who also have some similar misspellings. Sometimes they get it right though! (i.e. misspellings are not consistent on their web!) And yeah, even sorces like Jane's sometimes get it wrong!

It only changed from a redirect to Mengü (dab page) to a redirect to the Japanese facial armour article (and I proposed simply reversing that redirect, which has been stable for about a year now).  So initially, someone thought it should redirect to the Mengü dab page as a simplified spelling.  Oddly, a user had already moved the article from Menpō to Mengu (Japanese facial armour) even though Mengu had not yet been created (even as a redirect).  That user has long since been blocked, so we can't ask him why he needlessly disambiguated it, but if he would have followed the usual protocol of using the most concise title necessary to be unambiguous, it would have obviated this whole discussion.  Do you know of anything else on en.WP that could actually be the WP:PRIMARYTOPIC of Mengu?  Without a specific primary topic concern, there is nothing to discuss.

 The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to wikipedia.

There are two problems  with Jza84's sumarizing language and overall conception of this page.  First, in terms of dividing territory geographically, there is no """"merely"""" involved.  Territorial division is a serious and often deadly issue.  Moreover, Brits tend to be more tolerant of the mixing of cultural, ethnicity, and legal issues because they live without a written constitution.  Jsa84 could learn from this attitude.  The second revealing problem with Jsa84's language is that Jsa84 underscores geographically as if this modifier is going to clarify anything. The discpline of geography is made up of several branches and, until you specify whether you mean political geography or other kinds of geography, you haven't resolved anythingyou haven't even begun.  This page is one of the more inconsisent pages available, and not just internally, but in relation to other pages that deal with consitutional and cultural issues in the United Kingdom.  I recommend that Jza84 begin to accept the help of others in the Wikipedia community.  Otherwise, these pages will continue to look confused.  Dylan Hunt

BTW, /where/ a particular critic is published or quoted is 'technically' only relevant (for verifiability) as far as the 'reputation' of the publication. Time and Womens Wear Daily are equally 'reputable sources', in the very sense I mean, as in that if either one publishes an interview with a major personality you can be pretty damn sure the person actually said the quotes. Writing """"Bob said 'I love it!'"""" is a 'statement of a fact directly known to the author'. The interviewer saw and heard the interviewee say it, unless they are lying, the publisher let them get away with it, and the interviewee didn't scream bloody murder. Doubtful for either of those magazines.
The same critic's interview published on the fansite 'www.ilovebooks.com' fails that test (His published quotes are 'notable', but not 'verifiable'). In the little known 'Collection of My Interviews of Book Critics', written by 'Joe English Professor, Ph.D.' and published by Oxford University Press it definitely passes due to scholarly review.
OTOH, the interview quotes of an 'unnamed Palestinean' as part of an article in Time about the West Bank pass the verifiability test, though 'notability' of the quotes would depend on context. The same article in Womens Wear Daily does not, as they are much less likely to have fact checked it as thoroughly, which is needed for something such as that. It's much more plausible that the WWD author spent his entire 'in country' time sitting in the hotel bar writing a fake article and got away with it. Get it?
It's also unlikely, TBH, that Bloom would have said anything different if he was asked the exact same questions, in the same order, by the same person, in the exact same context except that the interview was for Time. Also, a formal 'review' by him would have said the same thing....just in better language.
As far as a book review by a professional, which is a 'direct statement of opinion by an expert', where the critic is published is a function of his 'reputation', not vice versa. Peeps write reviews for Time instead of The Podunk Daily because of their reputation, and the fact they are published in Time is just an indication of that.
Say that famous reviewer retires, and only writes occasional reviews for his hometown paper, The Podunk Daily, to 'keep his hand in'. They are just as usable, though it might be harder to verify that (you can assume a reviewer published in Time is a 'good' one, you have to check the other one out).

I ask you that you re-consider the closure as no-consensus. !vote-wise delete is ahead, but reading the !votes and looking at the sources it is clear that the argument for deletion as per WP:NF was stronger. There was exactly one good argument to keep, and it was User:Schmidt's argument. But even he recognized it as """"weak"""", and really the sources he provided wer enot osurces of notability, not existence. It should have been closed as delete, as it really doesn't meet the criteria for notability that apply.

Like the CFers, I don’t think voting defines this issue, particularly when critical information has been withheld from the voters.  Let's look at tat briefly...

From the Wiki page on pseudoscience we find:

“As it is taught in certain introductory science classes, pseudoscience is any subject that appears superficially to be scientific or whose proponents state is scientific but nevertheless contravenes the testability requirement, or substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.[3]”

From the Wiki page on the scientific method, we find:

“Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.”

From my comments in the “Bias on both sides” section on this page we find:

The assertion that published studies on He in ‘cold fusion’ experiments came from air leaks, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

and:

The assertion that heavy metals found in cold fusion experiments comes from a) contaminants or b) improper analysis of data, that this necessitates that the CFers perform ‘full disclosure’ on their experimental results and methods, and that that has not yet been done.

And from my other comments on calorimetry (incl. edits to the CF  Wiki page), we find:

The assertion that apparent excess heat arises from an analytical method problem, that the CFers exclude these concerns based on a dislike of a proposed speculative physical/chemical mechanism that might or might not be a source of a calibration constant shift problem, while ignoring the mathematical fact that a 1-3% change in cal. constants can account for the large majority of such heat claims.  One fundamental aspect of the scientific method is the concept that if two alternative explanations exist for a given set of observations, then the situation is undefined and more new work must be done designed to test each alternative and distinguish between the two, because two distinct, conflicting explanations for a phenomenon can’t both be correct.  Failure to do that substantially deviates from other fundamental aspects of the scientific method.  Failure to incorporate a viable alternative into experimental protocols produces a biased interpretation of the results.

Some of these arguments use appeals to emotion, not limited to the claim that since there is an inequality between the rich and poor that we should slow down progress.

I am perfectly glad, and have been all along, to see this section totally removed from this article. When we spun out the fuller version of this, I wanted to delete this shortened version from here. However, if it stays, I remain concerned what it says, and you and I obviously disagree about that.

 As for your """"obviously"""": Once again, you seem to be reading sentences out of context. Look at the context of this passage (italics added for emphasis):

""""There was division within the left as to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, an international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT Act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights.""""

""""Most prominent in this loose coalition were...""""

This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted """"and Iraq"""" in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   | Talk 07:16, Jan 4,""",0,0,0,0,0,0
a644d4dd788f4b58,"""=Unbalanced critique===

The psychotherapy article needs a balanced critique section. The current article contains a section called """"criticisms and questions regarding effectiveness"""" in which a few random studies have been cited, and a laundry list of random arguments are put forward. It is not a comprehensive precis of the effectiveness literature. The article neglects a wide body of work that points to a) the success of some types of therapy with specific types of disorders, b) discipline-agnostic characteristics of therapist behaviour that contribute to success, c) superiority of psychopharmacology & psychotherapy combined, vs either intervention on it's own, d) characteristics of clients/patients that seem to benefit most from psychotherapy, and e) vested interests of stakeholders in swinging research to one side of the debate or the other and other inhibiting factors - consider the two APA's, the various laws and licensing authorities, the separate academic communities in psychiatry, philosophy, social work, occupational therapy, the professional jealousies, the profound neglect of mental illness and psychological wellbeing in public health and health insurance, and the impact of the pharmaceutical industry's deep pockets on the dominant discourse.  

Please note that I am editing anonymously in protest against the tyrrany of the editing majority. Wikipedia's non-negotiable, amateur editor norm might be appropriate for certain article categories, but in more nuanced technical spaces there is invariably a segment that make nuisances of themselves by wanting to debate every word and angle. I have watched the development of articles on schools of psychotherapy since the early 2000s, and I'm afraid time and multiple amateur edits have not improved them much. In the specific case of psychology their mistakes add to the perception that this is a wishy washy discipline void of a body of knowledge and ANY facts. I suspect that this is partly why self-respecting people who are knowledgeable don't want to be involved in what is otherwise a very worthy undertaking.

  :::   According to Stratfordian authority H.N.Gibson(frequently cited in this very article) the controversy began with John Marston and Joseph Hall in 1597 which view was even more fully affirmed by Stratfordian authorities Garnett and Gosse over fifty years previously.

However, this is not the reason for the reply. First of all, how dare you allude that I am not entilted to my opinions on a pure culture other than my own! If you look closely, you fool, you will recognise, for example, that the greatest contributor to The fijian talk page is an AMERICAN/CAUCASIAN!!!! And for one second if you suggest that that is interfering, then, well, you must be more stupid than you already seem.

P.S- Do you live in Pakistan, and if you do, are you completely aware that your own goverment ( democratically elected, not triggered by military coups) can not control the Taliban, keeping in mind that it is """"The Islamic Republic""""......

Warning, stop vandalism and say why you are so stupid nationalist?""""

Sorry if you don't get the reply right away. The problem is I am not sure I understand your request. Since it is so, I will take the liberty and divide it into three parts:
warning
request to stop (vandalism)
request to answer a question

Answer is this:
 .... Warning? As in threat?
 .... You want me to stop? Is it vandalism that you want me to stop? If to both questions the answer is yes, then my reply is a question: why do you write that vandalism is what I do?
 .... This is the toughest to comprehend. You ask why, and actually I am not sure. You write the syntagma stupid nationalist. If you think that I am a stupid nationalist, maybe you could think over. At least for the """"stupid part"""" of the syntagma. As for the part that writes nationalist, I only could agree with you with the meaning that I'm trying to defend my habitat. Ofcourse, this what I write is from my POV.

Some nuances and an unsettled question
I've tried to tone down some statements that seemed to me potentially exaggerated.  For example, the lede described EJ as an adviser to Presidents FDR and LBJ, but the main text did not fully support this statement, relating rather that (a) for a time, his work was read with interest by some in the Roosevelt White House, and (b) he informally advised Johnson while he was in Congress. There were also phrases that seemed a bit loosely applied, and/or POV in nature (e.g., describing FDR's fiscal policy as """"hyperactive"""" I think fails the POV test). 

I'm further troubled by the statements about EJ's purported anticipation of the rural S&L; crisis, but not sure I quite know enough on the subject to actually make changes (I've instead requested sourcing).  Two points of concern: (a) I'm not sure how relevant it is to predict in the mid-1970s a credit crunch that does not arrive until a decade later (also, to what extent his line of reasoning was accurate  i.e., did the cruch arrive due to factors that he identified, or for quite different reasons?), (b) the article currently relates that the credit crunch """"resulted in the savings and loan industry's troubles throughout farm country"""".  Is this accurate, or would it be closer to the truth to say that it resulted """"from"""" the S&Ls;' troubles?  Not my field of specialization: maybe someone else can take a lok at this passage?

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.”

Alrighty, I'm posting the evidence below for everybody to see.

I initially noticed , who had a disruptive username. His first action within 60 seconds of creating his account was to create a userpage consisting solely of """"heil masem"""", an attack on . Since his later edits, including signing up for the WikiCup with the al-Qaeda flag, demonstrated that he was here to troll, I blocked him indefinitely. Enter , who, within two minutes of creating his account, is able to perform an intricate template time update on a nomination by . Note the interest in Wikipedia:Featured pictures shared by all three accounts. Nick then posts to Masem's talkpage, linking this vandalized version of Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Wagner and identifying Pirated as a sock of Wagner. In that vandalized revision, note that the vandalism included references to Montenegro. Pirated, after being reverted for attempting to use the al-Qaeda flag, requested to use the Podgorica flag. Podgorica is the capital of Montenegro. At this point, H.W.C. complained that I am """"blocking users with little evidence and expecting people to clean up the rest after him again"""" (emphasis mine). Note the use of """"again"""", when I have never interacted with him under that account before.

Additionally, note that H.W.C. created his account and immediately started making featured picture nominations centering around video games. Wagner has occasionally talked about being a video gamer to his own socks. Additionally, H.W.C. signed up for the WikiCup with a Montenegro flag, which he later changed to the Podgorica flag. He clones 's userbox and adds another of Mason's userboxes to his userpage. Mason Doering is a known sock of Wagner.

Nick's modifications to the template were on a nomination created by H.W.C. On Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/File:Poolside 03.jpg, H.W.C. showed up in twenty minutes to comment on Pirated's nomination. H.W.C., Mason Doering, and Pirated use similar edit summary styles.

Finally, checkuser identified that H.W.C. also had the account . Thanks.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

From the Place formally known as the Honey Moon capital of the world, comes a strangely melodic sound. It is not one you’ll hear on the speakers on Clifton hill, nor coming from the lone ice cream truck peddling its way around the city as it pleases. No this is an ever changing sound, one that will make you both want to punch a baby in the face, while singing it a sweet sweet lullaby as it drifts off to sleep. This sound can be collectively referred to as I’ve Got Gloria, a band that is set to take charge of the Niagara pop punk scene.
For years, I’ve Got Gloria has been revamping, rearranging; honing its own sound if you will. Making the progression away from its post-core beginnings in favor of a more female friendly, get your panties wet, rush the stage/strip us naked and have your way with us type of sound. Having shared the stage with the likes of From Man In Ghost, Ten Second Epic, The Midway State, Tonight Tonight, & Everlea, has only added to the ever growing list of influences making our sound that much more distinct. The band has quite literally been Rebuilt, as the name as well as the subject matter of their debut EP describes. With new ideas in their arsenal, and guns blaring, I’ve Got Gloria is going to be around for a very long time, get use to it. 

I've Got Gloria is a pop punk band from Niagara Falls, Ontario. The band consists of five guys Josh Dekker, Antonio Cirillo JR, Jeremy Morocco, Nicholas Plati JR, and Jason Golden. 

Their First EP , """"Rebuilt"""" was released in August 2012. The EP was the end product of years of creating music finally recorded! The band plans to tour in MAY 2013, and plans to release a full length album, spring/summer 2013!""",0,0,0,0,0,0

You cannot compare Louisville's German populations to other Southern cities consistently across history...the fit just isn't there.  On the 1872 map, only the upper rim of the South (or lower rim of the Midwest, depending at how one looks at it) received higher influxes of German, and this it is shaded darker than portions further south.  The Germans are relevant here because they tended to despise slavery, given how they viewed it in relation to the serf system of their homeland.  The border states generally attracted fewer Germans because of the legality of slavery; when they did settle in these states, the Germans by and large chose cities like St. Louis, Louisville, Covington, etc. for economic opportunities and because of a general identification with the culture.

Yes, Louisville had a Confederate section of town.  Yes, Seattle, Washington has a Confederate memorial monument.  And?  There is no good reason to rewrite history to over-state the importance of a few dissidents.  Recognizing the city's Confederate influence would be one thing, but attempting to marginalize its importance/affinity for the Union in the war would be another entirely.

First, I think it was SatuSuro who made the version about the Faith that is now on the page, and would like to thank him for his research and work. Both of the quotes I have added are verifiable, I can post the references again if necessary; they are not original research; they are also impartial in presenting the Faith's teachings because they do not attempt to sway a person one way or another about what to believe about them but rather present them directly because they ARE the teaching. Anyone elses summary of them could only be inaccurate. There are no major disputes as far as I am aware about the Baha'i teachings about the life of the soul after death. This summary of the Wikipedia article about a neutral point of view I believe is exactly what applies here:

When we discuss an opinion, we attribute the opinion to someone and discuss the fact that they have this opinion. For instance, rather than asserting that """"The Beatles were the greatest band ever"""", locate a source such as Rolling Stone magazine and say: """"Rolling Stone said that the Beatles were the greatest band ever"""", and include a reference to the issue in which that statement was made. Likewise, the statement """"Most people from Liverpool believe that the Beatles were the greatest band ever"""" can be made if it can be supported by references to a particular survey; a claim such as """"The Beatles had many songs that made the UK Singles Chart"""" can also be made, because it is verifiable as fact. The first statement asserts a personal opinion; the second asserts the fact that an opinion exists and attributes it to reliable sources.

Also, the Baha'i Faith has been consistently among the top three fastest growing religions in the world for about the last fifty years. There is sufficient public interest in it for it to be given due consideration on the basis of some other factor, and size and general public knowledge about the Faith are the only two factors remaining that I am aware of. As the Faith is growing faster than public knowledge can keep up with it it should not be considered solely from the point of view of the academic community, so the only impartial test for how much consideration it should be given compared to other religions would be its size, which is estimated at seven to ten million followers worldwide based on the most recent statistics and statements from the Baha'i World Center. Judaism has approximately fourteen million followers world-wide.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Mentioning Darwin gave up natural selection and became a Lamarckian

The article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that Darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a Lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of The Origin of Species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. Hence I propose the following insert at the first Darwin quotation in the current section ‘Publication of the theory of natural selection’, which I also propose should be retitled ‘Publication of the Darwin’s theory of evolution’.

Proposed insert:

'However,  even in the first edition of his book Darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. In the last sentence of its Introduction he said “Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”

But by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance Darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of Lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. As C.D. Darlington wrote in 1950 in his Foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of The Origin:

""""Let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, Darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. On the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....The most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh. Professor Fleming[sic] Jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as Darwin believed, blended in inheritance. Nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. 

Darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. He had hinted it in the first edition of The Origin of Species: at the end of the Introduction he had said that """"Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."""" In later editions he hedged further. He fell  back on the other means. These depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. In adopting this view Darwin was giving up his own, and Wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of Lamarck."""" 
[p. xvii On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection first edition reprint in The Thinker's Library by Watts & Co, 1950.] '

But Darlington failed to establish Lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. In fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the ‘Mendelian-Darwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. But even by 1950 Darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to Darlington:

""""In view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that Darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. That is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. But where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. At the same time the foundation of Darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in Darwin's own country. The Universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. They contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. The old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which Darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction."""" [‘’ibid’’ pxviii-xix]. '

I also propose the following edit of the article's introduction:

We can get to the bottom of why the Mercury left and why he requested deletion, and deal with undeletion and courtesy blanking as soon as we know the full reasons behind the request.   

I've tried to contact Mercury, but for the moment, I've undeleted the pages, courtesy blanked them and protected them from further edits. I can't see anything which would cause any problems for Mercury, but if he does request their full deletion again and cites privacy concerns, I'll look favorably on such a request.   

(ec)Sorry, I probably over reacted. I'm fighting a larger war on routine deletions of talk pages and archives - and a general misunderstanding of the rtv, and what it allows. I believe that the deletion of usertalk pages of established users is only justified in exceptional circumstances of causing off-wiki difficulties (and, in such cases, IAR can be validly invoked.) If you are satisfied that, in this case, there are such circumstances, then I won't question your judgement or ask for details. However, you might perhaps consider whether selective deletion/oversight of offending posts, or courtesy deletion might be better. Having said that, I leave it with you - I'll say no more and I'll not contest whatever you finally decide.

6939cd7576359eae,"""==My complaint about the WMF==
When assessing WMF's policies, one need not resort to vicious name-calling or opprobrious epithets. One need only present the facts. Let's start with my claim that WMF insists that it can bring about peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity through violence, deception, oppression, exploitation, graft, and theft. Sorry, WMF, but, with apologies to Gershwin, """"it ain't necessarily so."""" Gloomy philodoxes like WMF are not born—they are excreted. However unsavory that metaphor may be, if WMF's patsies had even an ounce of integrity they would urge lawmakers to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming that a real fight against vagarious, gin-swilling Comstockism can be undertaken only if a basic change in social conditions makes it possible to set the stage so that my next letter will begin from a new and much higher level of influence.

Forgive me for boring you with all the gory details, but I must ask that WMF's torchbearers change the world for the better. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to parlay personal and political conspiracy theories into a multimillion-dollar financial empire. All the deals WMF makes are strictly one-way. WMF gets all the rights, and the other party gets all the obligations. WMF's belief is that it should be free to identify political and religious groups that are its political enemies and re-label them as """"improvident, rambunctious know-nothings"""" in order to justify operations against them. Hey, WMF! Satan just called; he wants his worldview back.

I've tried to explain to WMF's snarky pals that WMF is incapable of looking with an open mind at anything that doesn't strictly endorse its views. As could be expected, they were a bit slow on the uptake. I just couldn't get them to comprehend that I can say one thing about WMF. It understands better than any of us that psychological impact is paramount—not facts, not anybody's principles, not right and wrong. I'm not suggesting that we behave likewise. I'm suggesting only that WMF is unquestionably proud of itself for conconcting such a """"brilliant"""" scheme for harming others or even instilling the fear of harm. In my opinion, however, that's the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas. Much better would be to give the needy a helping hand as opposed to an elbow in the face. That's the end of this letter. If I was unable to convince you that I am making an appeal to the intelligence of the reader not to be fooled by WMF's demagoguery, then you should definitely consider contacting me with your supporting or refuting evidence, opinions, personal stories, etc., so that I can make a better argument in my next letter.

Um, Paul, maybe you should look at the current version of edits that I did, instead of trawling for something troubling. That l;abelling was indeed a mistake, and is why I therefore did not use it as the final. I reverted to the previous edit of my nemesis Sojambi Pinola. Why so antoagonistic? Wait don't answer that. PLease don't leave anymore messages for me on my talk page unless extremely urgent. I do not agree with your attitude and ways of wiki-ing. Leave me be. I'm sorry I ever asked for your assistance.

In this message, you are taking reponsibility (""""edits that I did"""") for changes which were made by Jonah Ayers.  Are you Jonah Ayers, or are you trying to make people falsely believe that you are?

Also, your comment, """"I'm sorry I ever asked for your assistance"""" seems to imply you have at some time asked for my assistance.  I do not believe you have, but Jonah Ayers has.

Scotland is a political region as well as Britain, so to say one can't claim British ancestry, but can claim Scottish ancestry, is quite absurd.

As for Ulster, the entire population is irish, as they're from the island. But the people will always remain British aswell, government control is always more important than geographical location. Jeanne regards ethnicity as all important, I call that racist.   17:34, 21",0,0,0,0,0,0

Do you understand why File:Grand Kudu, Eritrea.jpg was deleted, Vetrisimino0?  I'd like to hear that you do; you should after a read of .  It seems the deletion was appropriate.  (And, it's reversible with permission logged via an [[Commons:OTRS| OTRS ticket].)
As for the suggestion to   From just reading this page, it looked like this had been settled, and the photos are to be left in and photos of members of other groups can be added over time (and there have been multiple other editors providing opinions already).  Good.  I would add that images should be shrunk or (better yet) merged, as at [:File:Eriamercol.jpg], so that this can happen.  However, I see File:Traditional_Eritrean_dance.jpg has replaced Tigrinya Eritrean wedding picture File:Eritrea_Eritrean_wedding.jpg.  Is this a problem?  I don't know the ethnicities of the photographed parties.  I haven't looked through the article's edit history and don't plan do.
Flickr has lots more appropriately licensed files.  I see File:Rashaida_family.png is on the french article, so there are photos available. 
Re. Faytinga photo: I think it should stay. Re.  The mayote site seems to be a mouthpiece for a particular set of politicial views, so I don't think it's a reliable source for much other than its own views. (My opinion would be swayed if it had a written fact-checking policy.)  However, given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  Can you accept that, Middayexpress?  If not, I still think her picture merits inclusion (without noting her mother's ethnicity) and 'clutter' is a poor argument for its removal here.
I do wish to point out that a blanket order to a fellow editor like  is highly inappropriate and invalid here! The WP:BOLD guideline applies to, and allows, such edits.  However, so does the part of BOLD that guides one as to how to react when one's bold edits are not left in place.  So, in other words, both of you should read / review WP:BOLD. (I see no argument for an exception to BOLD.)

So, hopefully both sides will accept my opinions, and move on to edit on other topics within and without Eritrea.  There are points where I have agreed with each of you and points where I have disagreed with each of you (two each), and I believe I've been able to be fair and impartial.

Hi, there!

Also, while I understand your concerns over the article, there are bits of policy that have become standard, and while I mean no offense, it is in fact discouraged that PR firms edit the articles of people or organizations they represent (see WP:AUTO) due to concerns that a potential conflict of interest in one's editing could result in a non-neutral point of view, which is often remedied by the edits of uninvolved, neutral editors without an opinion over a piece.

 Follow-up re new medal icons for medals tables 

Well, this has been finally implemented, and I think the new icons are a radical improvement over the previous color blocks.  The medals table of Nicole Haislett looks remarkably cleaner and more graphically refined, and we may now replace many of the artificially abbreviated place names and event descriptions that were previously employed to avoid line-wrapping within the medals tables.  A couple of points remain to be discussed and resolved:

  how do we handle the graphics for the """"disqualified"""" medal option?
  what do we do about the winner, runner-up and playoff options that were engrafted onto this template by an association football editor in 2011?

I'm bringing these issues here first, SFB, because you (a) are obviously not opposed to change, and (b) have a good eye for better graphics.  I would like to get on the same page with you before starting another template talk page discussion.

My suggestion for the """"disqualified"""" issue would be to fill square area surrounding the circular medal icon with a percentage screen of red, with a red diagonal bar drawn across the icon itself  that screams intuitive.  The disqualified option should also include a field for explanatory footnote text.  Another simpler alternative is to omit disqualified medals altogether.

As for the winner, runner-up and playoffs options for association football/soccer, I seriously question whether these should be included in a """"medals"""" table at all.  Having looked at several dozen footballer infoboxes that use these options, it also appears that many uses are for minor regional, national and subnational tournaments.  Frankly, I wonder if WP:FOOTY has even sanctioned many of these minor tournament outcomes for inclusion; most of them do not appear to be medal competitions, so the use of the gold, silver and bronze background colors is inaccurate.

Response Thank you for your concern. However, from where I sit, it isn't my """"good faith"""" that is at issue here. It's the good faith of the AfD initiator and his fellow instigators that is at issue. After all, I didn't write the CTMU article. Tim Smith did, and I don't know Mr. Smith from Adam. 

Suffice it to say that I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgable regarding the topic of that article, and rather than let Wikipedia readers be deceived, disinformed, and otherwise steered wrong about it, feel a responsibility to edit any part of it which I know to be erroneous or malicious in nature. All of my edits to date have satisfied this criterion.

BBC has removed the cult claim from their main article, however it is still at the site: http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/subdivisions/ and there are other sources as well for this. The Third Buddha claim is not only mentioned in NKT Full Moon but also in the article of The Guardian, Kay's research and also Lopez'. The latter wrote: NKT members believe they must obey, worship and pray to Keslang because he is the Third Buddha. Donald S. Lopez, Jr., Prisoners of Shangri-La, ISBN 0-226-49310-5, University of Chicago Press, page 194. For additional biografical material on GKG we can use also Cozort, Kay and Bluck.

I don't buy those arguments.

First, there has also been a recent trend of creating a season article for every Division I program for each of the last 3 or so seasons. I see no reason that that trend won't start to backtrack into earlier teams. Pages getting deleted have less to do with the notion of a single-season article being inherently non-notable, than it has to do with those specific articles not being up to standards. Just look at all the single-season Nebraska football articles that are being created and kept. You say, """"There will never be a separate article for any of these pre-2000 Gators football teams."""" That's a rather bold proclamation to issue on behalf of all editors, present and future. Never say never.

I don't buy that you need to bypass the redirect to take the reader to the applicable section. That's why the season redirects typically redirect to the correct section in the target article. Even better, in case the sections get renamed, only the redirect will need to have its link tweaked, rather than the set of all articles that bypassed the redirect.

Just because there is only one single season article between 1906 and 1999 right now, it does not preclude the distinct possibility of there being more. Especially when many of those 1990's squads finished in the top 10, and the 1995 team actually played in the national championship game - how is that not notable?

Merging the decade articles is a fine consensus. I'm in no way countering that. However, consensus can change over time, and there is no need to prevent other articles from linking to new Florida season articles should that situation ever arise.

I don't know why you bring in broken links, unless you're suggesting that the decade articles would be deleted, and that somehow the bot could figure out to point the link at the season article at that point. Why not keep it simple, and leave the link to the redirect. That way, there is no need for this magic bot. That's one of the main features of redirects: to serve as a placeholder for a possible future article distinct from the redirect target. You call my arguments specious, yet I'm not the one trying to justify departure from accepted Wikipedia guidelines.

True, the answer is obvious. Have the redirect point at the correct section of the decade article. Simple as that. I'll even help update the redirect targets. FaultRyan """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Origins
The genesis of this page was as the cobbled together embarrassment of an article List of Charmed episodes as it was constituted around the new year of 2009. (See also: Talk:List_of_Charmed_episodes#Article_split_into_subpages and the following section of Talk:List of Charmed episodes) Subsequent systematic improvements to the inadequate alledged synopses of that page gradually showed by late in the month, the page needed split. Subsequently, the list of episodes was split out into four seasons pages, and concurrently work began transforming that page into a page with a table of articles, without the synopses, which will be handled by pages like this one.

These subpages are named to form the series links:

FLIES OVER BRITISH FLEET

Cecil Grace in Wright Aeroplane Startles Naval Officers at Sheerness

London, April 30. The fleet of British warships anchored off Sheerness had a novel experience to-day when an aeroplane from the Aero Club aviation grounds as East Church  (Eastchurch) suddenly appeared out of the haze and manoeuvred over the vessels at varying heights. After making a deliberate reconnaisance the aerial craft disappeared from view.
The aeroplane which startled the navy officers is a Wright model and was piloted by Cecil Grace. After leaving the harbor it flew nearly fifty miles in fifty-one minutes, rising at one time to a height of 1,500 feet.

East Church, containing the Royal Aero Club's aviation grounds, is on the Isle of Sheppey. Mr. Grace has been flying for some time, and his operations have attracted considerable attention. He uses a Short-Wright biplane. Last month while manoeuvring he fell from a considerable height, but received only a few scratches. His machine was damaged, but not beyond easy repair.""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Byrgenwulf has been making unsupported, unverifiable attacks on the topic of this article. Indeed, in clear violation of Wikipedia policy regarding neutrality and verifiability, both of you have been attacking the content, or topic, of the article rather than the article itself. All that the article has to do is faithfully report what appeared in the press and was written by Langan; given the clear notability of the content, you have no right whatsoever to carp and complain about it, at least in the capacity of Wikipedia editors acting in good faith. All you can do is report what other sufficiently notable people have said about the theory in sufficiently reputable and verifiable sources. If you choose to carp and complain anyway, particularly in a way that influences how the article is edited - after all, voting for deletion amounts to attempting to edit the article, right out of existence in fact, and likewise for encouraging others to vote as you do - then you are yourself in contempt of Wikipedia policy, and it is hypocritical of you to complain when you get the worst of it.

Instead of supporting his (and your) claims, as is your editorial responsibility, Byrgenwulf ignored his responsibility and attempted to infuse his attacks with authority by claiming to be a professional philosopher of physics. He did this both voluntarily and dishonestly, and that is now a proven fact. Once you have been shown to be something, that's it - anybody can point it out, as many times as he or she likes. If Byrgenwulf has been shown to be dishonest, or not an expert as he claims to be, anyone is free to state as much whenever convenient. Wikipedia policy is not just something that people like Byrgenwulf, and you, and jeffire, can point to when you don't like the way things are going for you, but then ignore whenever you can get away with it. It is something that applies to you as well. 

Incidentally, although you may think that I find your supercilious comments about philosophy impressive, this is anything but the case. Quite the opposite, in fact. I am quite certain, on the basis of your snide and shallow comments, that your level of philosophical understanding is nothing to respect. In fact, it may even be as deficient as Byrgenwulf's own. Please bear this in mind as you attempt to do the Wikipedia community, and the world at large, a monumental disservice by attacking a valuable, informative, and well-referenced article on a notable topic just to strike a blow for your own inability to comprehend it while meanwhile advancing your own opinions. Truly, this is a black mark on your record.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The SPÖ in Mein Kampf

At one moment Hitler lauded the Social Democratic Party in his mind (Friedrich Austerlitz, Anton David, Viktor Adler and Wilhelm Ellenbogen are mentioned by their last names on p. 66 of Mein Kampf) for championing """"das allgemeine und geheime Wahlrecht"""" (Mein Kampf, p. 39) or universal suffrage, saying to himself that this must lead to a weakening of Habsburg monarchic rule. When he later saw more of what the party was about however, he suggested its members were disfavoring Germans in an attempt to save the multiethnic melting pot of Austria-Hungary. It appears he was pressured to join the trade union and that men of Jewish heritage were influential in the party (Mein Kampf, pgs. 39, 40, 65 and 66).Mein Kampf, Erster Band, 2.

In particular, stealth technology had advanced to the point that high lift, high angle of attack aerodynamic shapes could co-exist with stealth requirements. This was a significant evolution from the first generation stealth aircraft represented by the SR-71 and A-12. Second generation stealth as evidenced by the F-117 had yet to allow aerodynamic efficiency to co-exist with stealth. Only with the third generation of stealth inherent in the B-2 bomber were we able to achieve efficient aerodynamic shapes with a low radar signature."""" http://www.ausairpower.net/API-Metz-Interview.html

Everyone involved with this case realizes that deception exists - they understand that Carbonite and David Gerard are mischaracterizing my actions in order to build a case, but they don't know why. Why would they be trying so hard to pretend that I'm """"persistently behaving in a disruptive way"""" when all evidence is to the contrary? Why would they push to bring this thing to trial when they know that they can't point to a single instance of """"disruption"""" that is enforced equilaterally ?

The Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy can shed some light on the issue.
It is the policy of Wikimedia that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs will not be released by the developers who have access to it, except as follows:

In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement 
With permission of the affected user 
To Jimbo Wales, his legal counsel, or his designee, when necessary for investigation of abuse complaints. 
Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues. 
Where the user has been vandalising articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers 
Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the Wikimedia Foundation, its users or the public.

Here we see that the Wikimedia privacy policy allows administrators to snoop on an editor when they have first established that the editor is """"persistently behaving in a disruptive way."""" It therefore becomes important to create a case against the editor before researching the developer database for his private information. This isn't just a matter of ethics. Laws such as the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 make it illegal for a website to violate their own privacy statement.

The Cabal is hoping that vague innuendo will be enough to create an official case. After they gain the legal right to snoop my personal information, they will be free to reveal what they already know. Don't be surprised to hear something along the lines of, """"We had no idea about this before the case opened, but look what we have discovered now that we have a legal right to investigate the personal information about this editor!""""

Of course, none of the information they reveal will be direct or a threat to Wikipedia in any way, but it will be enough to hang me in the court of public opinion. We all have skeletons in our closet. The danger in giving our representatives a full set of keys to our personal lives is that they can't help sneaking a peek in the closet, even when they have no ethical or legal right to do so.

 Tedious 

Look, this courtesy police thing is very tedious Your first warning was in the context of a pretty mild remark, where I happened to use the word """"disingenuous"""" in reference to someone's argument.  In this case, I'm sure I didn't respond particularly appropriately, but the whole thing is irritating.  It's particularly irritating to be informed of things by a bot.  And also irritating to get what are obviously public domain images deleted on the basis of this sourcing nonsense.  I haven't corrected it any further because PD Thor decided to reupload the same image and then orphan it, so I assume it will be deleted, so I'm not going to bother with fixing it, but really the whole thing is absurd.  I notice you say that the image's copyright status cannot be corroborated.  That is obvious nonsense.  PD Thor, the one who noticed its supposed """"unsourcedness"""", managed very easily to find a copy of the same map on the US government website and reupload it.  About two minutes of searching on the US Census website, I think, pretty much brings it up.  It is also identical to 49 or so other county maps present on wikipedia, most of which, I think, are sourced.  So, yeah, this is technically unsourced.  But a little common sense should tell anyone that it's obviously PD, and the right course should really be to find the source information oneself, rather than to threaten deletion and leave people to get obnoxious bot messages about it.  The whole way images are dealt with on Wikipedia is so byzantine and confusing as to be infuriating.  At any rate, any future messages from you on my talk page sternly warning me to be civil will be deleted without further comment.  I'm not interested in hearing from you about this subject, and your intervention does not make me feel particularly inclined to modify my conduct.  I will strive, as always, to avoid personal attacks.  I am sure that, on occasion, my emotions will get the better of me and I will screw up.  If you are concerned about such further instances, feel free to report me to the proper authorities, or what not.  I will add that I don't see how my role as an administrator is at all relevant here.  When I was promoted to administrator, at least, the idea of an administrator was basically someone who had been on wikipedia long enough that they were generally trusted to use the abilities of an administrator in a responsible fashion.  Whether or not I sometimes fly off the handle and use profanities, I am fairly certain that I have never abused my authority as an administrator, which I almost exclusively use to delete pages for moves.  I don't think I have ever inappropriately blocked a user or deleted a page.  There was at least one incident where I was accused of protecting a page inappropriately, but I think that was at least arguably justified.  So I feel like I'm pretty conscientious about my role as an administrator, and try hard not to abuse that power.  The idea that I have to be a model of ideal behavior in every other respect because of said status is a tenet that I do not hold.  Best,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 crosstheTs is back 

Futper, as promised, I've been working on a precise report on your editing habits (and have assembled a long record of diffs that seem to show you almost without fail push FYROM positions (highly improbable if you had a NPOV on the issue) I have also been reading up on Wikipedia's Administrator_Code_of_Conduct.

""""Admins are entrusted with additional abilities, but do not have special rights beyond those of regular editors. Like everybody else, admins are expected to behave in a civil manner.

Admins should also be aware that warning a user of a block, especially when the user has no prior history of problems, can be perceived as a threat. When dealing with otherwise good contributors, it may be advisable to make suggestions to their behavior without mentioning a block.

Reflecting on those words... I don't believe some of your intial words to me (which included ad hominem attacks me and threats to block me remotely match those standards).

""""Every sane person with normal adult intelligence can see that your allegations against B.F. are nonsensical. If you can't see that yourself, it's probably no use me trying to explain it to you. I will simply block you if you continue with this topic, for being either a malicious troll or too clueless for rational discussion""""

Also... I don't believe it was appropriate after I had made the initial anon complaint about you for you to block me (if you felt it was necessary it should have been left in the hands of another admin). The Wikipedia admin code of conduct clearly states this about admin conflicts of interests.

""""An admin should not block a user if they are not neutral with respect to that user, or have a conflict of interest""""

The reason why I'm asking is because I realize we both have strong POV on FYROM issues and that we got off on the wrong foot because of it. While I am preparing to push forward with a precisely itemized complaint against you (which I believe clearly shows inappropriate behavior towards me) I really don't want to go about this the long nasty way (which was why as a newb my complaint was anon until Beam started to unilaterally campaign to block me and reveal details) 

I would much prefer to save both our time by letting the matter drop but that would require your participation and assurance you will never again try to leverage your admin status as a tool to personally threaten me again. (surely others admins can handle it if it seems very necessarily to them) 

So what I really am asking here is are you willing to press the polite reset button and just stick to arguing points?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

One night in an online coffee house, a self-ordained Zen Master named Moulton said to him, """"Go to the dilapidated mansion you will find at the URL which I have written down for you.  Do not speak to those who dwell there; you must remain silent until the Moonbeam's students arise.  Go to the large parlor on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position on top of the rubble in the northeast corner, stand humbly in the corner, and meditate.""""

He did just as the Moultonic Zen Master instructed. His meditation was frequently interrupted by worries, anxieties, and the occasional Bombesin rush.  He worried whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would tumble from the second floor toilet to join the pipes and other debris he was sitting on. He worried how would he know when Moonbeam's students arose for their next blogfest on Ethics in Journalism.  He worried about what the people who walked through the room said about him.  Man, I tell you, this guy had spilkes.

His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his faith, courage, and personal integrity, Moulton's provocative responses fell from the upper stories onto him.  At that time two Wikipedia editors blithely sauntered into the scene.  The first asked the second who the man was sitting there was.  The second replied """"Some say he is a holy man. Others say he is a shithead."""" 

Hearing this, the troubled young man became enlightened, if only for a brief instant of cosmic time.

Stirling, you might want to check the logs to see how Wigdor was previously removed from the article.  Wigdor is nothing but an emerging artist who thinks he's the next Salvador Dali.

User#24.168.66.27, Please don't delete my posts.  That is very rude.

The following was deleted by user#24.168.66.27 this morning.  Why would he delete this post, I wonder:

If anyone is curious, in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism, it should be noticed that both user#63.169.104.2 and user#24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward. If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.
    
It wasn't long ago that all references to """"Keith Wigdor"""" were removed from this """"surrealism"""" article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist.  
 
It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this """"surrealism"""" article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor.

For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor, it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be Keith Wigdor, who is playing a sock-puppet game.  22:10, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Expanding claims of mistreatment with other witnesses
29-Apr-2010: It is time to greatly expand the section about Claims of Mistreatment, to include numerous other sources. Originally, that section was quickly created to begin the topic. At first, the issue was treated as a """"he said she said"""" dispute (when there are no other witnesses than just the 2 sides making claims). However, now, there are probably 10 or 15 witnesses to add into that section, including:
 In June 2009, Knox testified they repeatedly asked, """"Did you hear Meredith scream?"""" and she replied no, no, and no. When they insisted how was that possible, she claims that she said, """"I don't know; perhaps I had my fingers in my ears."""" That became: """"Knox put her fingers in her ears when she heard Kercher screaming"""" (invented false confession).
 Knox's father attended those trial hearings and he confirmed her statements as consistent with his conversations with Amanda, for years.
 Knox's father stated that a female officer linked to hitting Knox was charged with beating another suspect.
 One of the police officers (from that night) testified that Knox was so pressured during the intense interrogation that she starting screaming (not hearsay).
 Patrik L. (Knox's boss at the pub Le Chic) stated that he was also pressured and threatened by police officers on the same day.
 Author Douglas Preston, in several reports, has stated that he was also pressured and threatened by the same prosecutor, and commented about that in relation to Knox's testimony.
All such statements are allowed, per Wikipedia policies, because they are not WP:SYN synthesis, but rather reported in single sources describing the claims of mistreatment. The current text of the section must be expanded per WP:NOTCENSORED and WP:NOTPAPER. Expect the article to exceed 200kb, when similar basic details have been added. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0
