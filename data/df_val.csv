 Hello, 

 I noticed that you were involved in WikiProject Skyscrapers, and I thought you could help me. I am trying to take Skycity to DYK, considering what an interesting hook it will make. For which, I intend to expand the article as much as I can (to meet DYK expansion standards). For this I request your help to expanding the article and making it a truly great hook. 

 I am trying to keep all edits at  so that we have more than the traditional 7 days to finish this hook. Hope you shall help!!! 

 Thanks and cheers!!"

Teagan began training in dance and gymnastics when she was only 7. She relocated to California when she was 10. She went on to dance with Joffery Ballet and later she was accepted into the American Ballet Theater. When she was 15, Teagan Presley represented the United States at dance and at gymnastic events in Germany and Denmark. Teagan continued competing nationally until she graduated high school at the age of seventeen. When Presley turned 18 Teagan performed in her first pornographic film in January of 2004. After her first movie she has appeared in 40 porn movies in the next 8 months; much of which were anal scenes. In late 2004, she signed an three-year exclusive performing contract with the adult movie studio Digital Playground.

 ==Buried Alive== 

 The article is clearly a grisly read.  However, I wish to confirm what the article says as true:  
 In the Criminal History section, the article states:  
 """"After she stated she would go to the police, Lockett decided to bury her alive.[10] Lockett ordered an accomplice to bury her while she was still breathing. She died from two wounds from a shotgun fired by Lockett."""" 

 1) Are we saying that Lockett SHOT Neiman and then ordered her to be buried alive?   

 2) Has the coroner to Neiman said that she died from the gunshot wounds ONLY?  
 
 3) Did Neiman suffocate WHILST she was dying from the gunshot wounds?  

 4) The upshot of this is that was Neiman dying (and suffering) from being buried alive whilst (presumably) bleeding to death from gunshot wounds?   

 5) How long was Neiman conscious for whilst/after being buried?   

 It just seems a little difficult, from an objective point of view, to say that someone can be being killed by multiple causes, to then lay the cause of death to one cause (again this must be in coroner's report).   

 I should say sorry to ask the cleary difficult questions, but such a crime deserves some specificity so that people can be sure of what precisely happened.   

 I might add that even if Lockett was an evil person (and looking at his life experience, it is not clear that he 'chose' evil) we as a civilised society have no place in making him suffer and die in a painful way.  If you have to kill him for a rational reason (as a deterrent or to save resources) that's one thing, but by killing him this way, the State has shown that it is no different from the other criminals in its vindictiveness - and that's a bad place to be.  Of course, the mechanisations that surround Lockett's death do reflect negatively upon the American State (and those who engineered the inhumane nature of Lockett's death).

 == Quick Vand Question == 

 I did a bit of RC patrolling this evening, and I wondered about something.  When is the slate wiped clean for IPs, so when should you start again with the first warning?   

 :It depends. If it's a shared IP address (indicated on the talk page), then it's likely that many different users are using that specific address. If you think that a user is experimenting with Wikipedia for the first time, you may give him/her a first-level warning. But since you never really know if you're dealing with a new user in these cases, you have to use your intuition. 
 :For static IP addresses (one user per address), it's easier. Then you're dealing with the same user the whole time, so you only have to use the first warning once (the first time).

 ==balance== 
 This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word, and a huge amount about the slang/profane uses. Perhaps the former should be extended; is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name? This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary.  

  
 i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipedia...IMMEDIATLY. this word is used very often and is also a very """"mean"""" word. i belive that is majorly true. very much so. okay so, the good meaning is a female dog.  BITCH !!!!!!!!!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 ==etymology== 
 The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning """"female of the dog"""" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that """"the converse is equally possible."""" 
 The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  
 The verb meaning to complain in 1930. 
 Slang Bitchen """"good"""" is attested to the 1950's 

 == reclaiming the word bitch == 
 The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is """"pig"""", """"dog"""", """"cow"""" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to """"reclaim"""" as bitch simply means a female canine. 

 It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. 

    
 It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women """"reclaiming"""" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word """"bitch"""" any more than it reclaims the word """"sinner."""" 

 Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? 

 

 :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, """"She's a Bitch"""".   

 ::References are fine  just the name """"Missy Elliot"""" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned """"reclaiming"""" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   

 :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting """"querolous"""", """"spiteful"""", and """"malicious"""" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   

 ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   

 :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like """"bitch"""" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of """"bitch"""" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it. 

 :::::However, I still don't see the point of reclamation, for if """"bitch"""" were purged of contem"

 == Semi-protected edit request on 15 August 2015 == 

  

  
 Please excise from the Preamble heading the paragraphs I've reproduced below, in which the text of the Preamble is dissected, needlessly, and made subject to a myriad of specious editorial claims that are not and will never be substantiable, no matter how many sources one tacks on after the period. The text of the Constitution is the text of the Constitution. To assume that """"a more perfect union"""" refers back to the government under the Articles of Confederation is to take a liberty that the context doesn't allow. The phrase may be referencing England or France or the Ottoman Empire. It may be an expression of the founder's desire to create a union more perfect than all the unions that have come before and all the unions that have yet to come. Unfortunately, the Constitution doesn't explain what exactly it means by """"a more perfect union"""" and as a result neither can we. In addition to being groundless, the analysis is riddled with nonsense terms, such as """"the powers of the earth,"""" """"social contract of democratic philosophy,"""" and """"things of a general welfare."""" The final sentence of the second paragraph is plainly incoherent.  

 Ultimately, my request is that the paragraphs at issue be deleted and replaced with the text of the Preamble verbatim. 

 -""""One people"""" dissolved their connection with another, and assumed among the powers of the earth, a sovereign nation-state. The scope of the Constitution is twofold. First, """"to form a more perfect Union"""" than had previously existed in the """"perpetual Union"""" of the Articles of Confederation. Second, to """"secure the blessings of liberty"""", which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation, but for all who came after, """"our posterity"""".[27] 

 It is an itemized social contract of democratic philosophy. It details how the more perfect union was to be carried out between the national government and the people. The people are to be provided justice, civil peace, common defense, those things of a general welfare that they could not provide themselves, and freedom. A government of """"liberty and union, now and forever"""", unfolds when """"We"""" begin and establish this Constitution.

 ::I might actually have to offer a word or two for Urthogie here.  While I haven't compared the full extent of the changes, I think his effort to better organize the article actually makes some sense, disagreements notwithstanding.  Looking at the version before, for instance, one serious problem is the huge reliance on quotes, and beyond that, quotes which offered almost nothing in the way of explanation.  If you look at the old """"Use of the term"""" section, specifically, the explanation really stopped with Adam and Moodley, then proceeding into a quote farm of people making the allegation.  We then had an explicit list of the same kinds of quotes, apparently by more prominent individuals though not clarifying this. We then had a section on the UN, slightly out of place, followed by the long section on people lambasting use of the term, again without really any explanation.  Only after all that did we actually have an explanation of what all these people are talking about.   

 ::Urthogie's version, while quickly done, actually seems to solve much of this, by splitting it up into three ways in which the allegation is used, so that we can actually have some context and explanation.  Already this division is contextual information the other didn't provide.  He then provides the quote list, but followed directly by a discussion of the conditions.  At least on a surface level, this seems to make sense.  Perhaps partially as a result, he's also then trimmed up the """"Use of the Term"""" section to remove what were really just examples, to something that could be built into a more encyclopedic explanation (possibly using the rest of Adam and Moodley). 

 ::In any case, that's not to say I agree with all of the changes.  For one thing, I'm not sure the """"Allegations that Israel is an Apartheid State"""" section should really be a section of its own.  If anything, I'd move it to third, as in """"Some people make the allegation without specifying what exactly they're referring to.""""  Perhaps others should give it another look, though?

 == there may be a lot of subtle issues in the quoted double blind study == 

 The """"scientific double blind"""" that claims """"no effect"""" could have numerous issues. My observations are as follows: 
 I consumed a great deal of sugar products as a kid and I remember there was no obvious effects that outsider could notice but there was definitely a subtle addictive effect - as in a craving for more sugary products after a while. The addiction comes back very quickly after sugary snacks, and the only cure is to not have any sugary products in the house, if there are any, one can't really resist eating them. 

 As an adult I have noticed the """"rush"""" also and this was witnessed on a TV show Survivor as well where the adult who was said to be sugar-free for years, consumed various such products on camera and experienced what I remember experiencing after being a month of sugar free and then consuming *Extreme* amounts of sugar (cooking accident). The effects were very similar, unstoppable giggling (I remember giggling for like 5 minutes straight even though I wanted to stop). Though if you just consume the sugar product and don't have some funny thing to initiate the giggling/laughter, then it may not happen - the point is, once it does start, you have no control over it if you are, clear,y intoxicad with sugar. 

 So proving this scientifically requires quite a bit of preparation and right circumstances. I doubt the studies so far have gone to such effort. It's also possible some people are more pre-disposed to the sugar effects. Personally I find that I have LESS focus to think through out the day when consuming even tiny amount sugar products, it clouds the thoughts for me but this is extremely subtle and you'd have to be doing some very serious intellectual work to notice this effect."""

 Hello Mr. Siegel. I would kindly like to ask you to read the article in its entirety and give three examples of advertisement in the article. I have edited the article more than four times now. One admin undeleted the article once before, but Trivialista and Tokyogirl, etc. other users believe it still to be advertisement. The Columbus Dispatch wrote an article about it. The C. Dispatch is the biggest Newspaper in Ohio and the article was on the cover. The company was in TV broadcasts, where reporters reported about the tech, etc. The company showcased their products at a booth at the geneva auto convention in Switzerland. 

 The Article was written in a way to show how the technology works. To my knowledge there is no sentence or phrase contained within the body of the article that coould allure advertisement. 

 Regardless, maybe you can help me and point out the sentences that would deem it so, if there are any. I am new to wiki and haven't contributed anything other than the article.

This statement actually does a fair job, I think, of trying to explain your side of what's wrong. Unfortunately they, too, start backing up their viewpoint with patently false (maybe uninformed) claims about many of the pro-gamergate editors who were also topic-banned. I'm writing, also, because I think you and the other editors were largely doing a good thing - but this was a wake-up call that things were getting out of hand on both sides, the other side did win because your side blew up. But ArbCom can't/won't/either/both take the stand that people don't have to be held accountable for their reactions, even if provoked, and especially when those reactions are causing a breakdown of legit consensus-based neutral article building. I'm just hoping this media attention brings in enough energy so no one has to get that jaded, and the article building can keep going in a neutral encyclopedic fashion. ﻿ "

38105c54f441f7d0,"== Terminology as theory == 

 Much of the article, and the comments here, are written as though there were a 'thing' which has the name 'infinitive'. Actually, linguistic terminology, like scientific terminology, arises from and is embedded in theories about language. English used to be described as if it were a language like Classical Latin or Greek; in this framework, an English 'infinitive' is whatever seems to be analogous to an infinitive in those languages. It's questionable whether 'infinitive' is a useful term at all in a truly stand-alone description of modern English. If it is, the case needs to be made purely in terms of modern English, and not by reference to other languages. 

 A similar argument applies to modern Greek. To call the form of the verb which is used after the auxiliary έχω (to form various tenses which didn't exist in classical Greek) an 'infinitive' is hard to justify by any definition. The form can't be used anywhere else, which is quite uncharacteristic of infinitives. 

 More generally, the entire article is grossly under-referenced. Inline citations are needed all over it to demonstrate that editors are not just expressing their pet views."

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.  

 If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Proponents of homeopathy,  9/11 conspiracy theorists, anti-vaccinationists, global warming denialists, and cold fusion evangelists will have a field day every quarter, as they strive to take down the admins who are now barely (and still not entirely) holding them in check.

 ==AI isn't as bad as that== 
 I've seen lots of comments that the AI is really bad and will just blindly run into you to stay on its preprogrammed racing line.  As I do real racing in RL, I thought I would point out something about this.  What I have found is that the AI will respect you and change its line to avoid hitting your car when you are making a legitimate pass.  But if you're somewhere you have no right to be, it will take you out into the dirt where you belong.  And RL racers will do that, too.  It seems to me that most human players expect the AI to drive off the road and surrender positions to avoid contact with the player as they swing their car around wildly on the track to make inappropriate passes.  And it just doesn't.  Therefore, it's """"stupid"""".  But real drivers will punt idiots off the track, too.  Normally, drivers who don't know how to pass and be passed aren't allowed on the track in the first place.  That's what racing licenses are about.

 Hi, I've been working on an article on Joshua Dratel and had gotten it to be a decent little stub. But then when I went to create it I discovered that it had been previously AFD'd and deleted from both versions of his name. Once I saw that I decided my stub needed to be a little better than decent so I've been working on it. Somebody just pointed out to me that you're working on an article on Joshua Dratel also, so I figured I should contact you. 

 Obviously I think the guy is notable and don't agree with the Delete arguments set out at the AFD. Still, I'm going to take those arguments seriously, so I want any new Joshua Dratel article to refute those arguments beyond a shadow of a doubt. I don't think the draft you've written quite does that as clearly as I like. (I'm not saying you haven't put a ton of work into it, you clearly have.)

 During March and April 1959, at Wheeler's request, Everett visited Copenhagen, on vacation with his wife and baby daughter, in order to meet with Niels Bohr, the """"father of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics"""". The visit was a complete disaster; Everett was simply unable to communicate the core idea that the wavefunction should be regarded as a real classical field; this was simply heresy to Bohr and the others at Copenhagen. The conceptual gulf between their positions was simply too wide to allow any meeting of minds; Léon Rosenfeld, one of Bohr's followers, talking about Everett's visit, described Everett as being """"undescribably stupid and could not understand the simplest things in quantum mechanics"""". Everett later described this experience as """"hell...doomed from the beginning""""[5].""""

 Hi. I see from your edit history that you've just been on Wikipedia for a couple weeks. Just to follow-up on the punk rock matter: basically, the more established an article is, the more you need to be prepared to verify your information and cite good sources for things you're interested in adding (the existence of a record itself is not generally considered a good source, unless it's got detailed liner notes that can be cited).  

 For new articles or ones still at any early stage of development, the practice is a little looser, and any information that steers the article in the right direction tends to be seen as helpful. The punk rock article happens to be one of the most established articles on Wikipediathat little star on the top upper right of the article tells you it's a Featured Article, one of our best. (You can look at the whole list of Featured Articles hereWP:FAto get a sense of how they look and specifically the kind of citations they have.) Anything you add to a Featured Article or what's been designated a Good Article (just a tier below) will generally have to pass a pretty high standard of verifiability.

 == Dizi == 

 Wow, you know a lot about dizi players!  I had a Chinese music teacher who played the dizi who was from Wuxi.  He said he'd studied (maybe at the Shanghai Conservatory?) with a very famous dizi player, the man who had invented the koudi.  Is he one of the three you mention or should he be added?    

 OK, here's his name: Yu Xunfa.  He invented the koudi in 1971.  Do you want to add him?    

 I think Yu's a big name.  Regarding the list of guzheng players, you're right, it's very long (as is the player list in the erhu article).  Maybe the list could go to its own page, and the """"prominent players"""" section mention just the most prominent (as well as a few foreigners who are doing interesting things with the instrument).

 :::Does it even matter whether you think Blood is a franchise article or not? It holds more common ground than Sailor Moon article. The structure of both Sailor Moon and Blood: The Last Vampire are strikingly similar with little to no difference, the only difference being is one labeled a """"franchise"""" and the other isnt. Oh and also Blood has alternate tellings with their own multiple media (which is why its compared to GITS over sailor moon) covered in their own article.So hypothetically if Sailor Moon gained an alternate telling that meritted its own article.

Does the Sailor Moon """"franchise"""" article create a novel section for the Sailor Moon X novels and compile the Sailor Moon X manga adaptation along with the Sailor Moon original manga?

Saying that Papandreou is pro Kosovo is almost like saying that if Behgjet Pacolli became the Swiss President he would have taken the anti Kosovo attitude or that Hillary Clinton was only hiding her pro Serbian stance when she talked about Kosova. I found a few statements by Papandreou about Kosovo like """"its unilateral recognition is a flagrant violation of international law and added that Greece's insistence on international law is a profoundly patriotic stance"""". Sounds much stronger than what Karamanlis and such have said.

 :: I Agree that the template should be removed completely. This is a No-Brainer   
 First: To address Sterrettc's argument above: The argument that LGBT is not an """"organization"""" is clearly disingenuous. The premise of the argument to have the LGBT template removed is that the placement of that portal clearly violates neutrality of the article. It is clearly one faction whose intent was to have the policy lifted, and frankly, has nothing directly to do with the content of the article. There is no wiggle room for your position. 
 Second: To address Ruoyyssey's position: Linking it to this article is indeed an advertisement for the LGBT position. Again, try to get past your bias and look at the concept for what it is. For example; if a group that supported the ban, such as the United States Pastor Council (USPC) were to have their logo (image) with links to similar website located where the LGBT image ois located; I have no doubt that countless people who support the abolition on the DADT policy would be screaming to have the USPC image removed. Additionally, your reference to the occasional """"vandalism"""" suffered by the logo, demonstrates your need to simply skirt the primary issue. Images, web pages, and logos are vandalized every day on this website and well as numerous others. In fact, when someone emoved the website from the page and opted for a blank area for this DADT article, it was deemed as """"vandalism"""". That is not vandalism, and your efforts to equate it as such is yet another effort to draw attention away from the fact that the LGBT logo, with it's links has no place within this article.

The fetish of animal roleplay may also be considered reverse anthropomorphism, something notable in furry yiff role-players whom also do this (by fursuiting or online interactive virtual reality or MUCKs (i.e. like those in Second Life). The interest in yiff, sexual human-animal roleplay and bestiality, etc, may be collectively caused by mixed fetishes and/or paraphilias towards animal traits or simple, although scientists are now debating over whether the sexual attraction to animal traits is a real sexuality or not, and if it is, on re-thinking sexuality altogether, as written in a recent article by the Scientific American."""

 == Response to Ebralph and nobs == 

 I have read all the posts and you have not addressed any of the issues to any satisfactory degree. Your primary assumptions derive from your wholesale and entirely uncritical acceptance of Klehr and Haynes, and others of the same outlook. You accept their narrow arguments at face value, with merely one bare note to the contrary. Nor is there any context. You appear to be unaware of the vast literature that surrounds the era, and thus are incapable of bringing in other comparative lines that might moderate your view. You are writing history here, you cannot merely throw in at the end one paragraph of Navasky and believe that mitigates the totality of the bias. 

 You spend your time diddling on the discussion page over which individuals were really espionage agents, while the article itself throws 349 in the wash, claiming as proven fact that they all had covert relations with the USSR. This is absurd. Not even Whittaker Chambers claimed Donald Hiss to be a spy, and to claim I. F. Stone, of all people, as an agent is merely insane. Ebralph's suggestion to me that I provide sources for the innocence of any specific named individual is again demonstrable of intent. You have merely taken the assertion of guilt based on names found in a file, then ask others to prove they are not. You cannot prove a negative. I cannot prove that you yourself are not, were not, a Soviet spy. One can only point out that the case provided comes nowhere near proving the assertion. 

 Many of your statements are just plain sloppy, which leads me to wonder just how well you know the field. What does it mean to say that Venona shows """"Ethel was guilty of cooperation""""!? It is utterly meaningless. There is no such crime as """"cooperation."""" The question is whether she was an accomplice by action or deed, and that remains just that, a question. Cable #1657 states openly that she did not work, but was aware of her husband's activity (which is not a punishable crime), neither did she have a code name, which points again to her not being involved. But, golly gee, despite the fact that this purports to be an article on the VENONA transcripts you neglect to mention what they actually say and merely assert a conclusion. This is not history, but diatribe.  

 Her brother has admitted to being coached to say that she did the typing  the prosecution needed that to tie her in, as mere knowledge of her husband's activities was not a crime. On Feb. 8, 1951, one month before their trial began Myles Lane of the Justice Department met with in secret session with the Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy. He informed them that the Department believed Julius was the """"keystone to a lot of other espionage agents"""" and that the only thing that would break him was the """"prospect of the death penalty."""" He then added that it was important to give Ethel """"a stiff sentence,"""" also as a means to break Julius, even though the case against her """"was not too strong. . .  it is about the only thing you can use as a lever against these people."""" At that the point the case against Ethel was nonexistent. They knew she was aware of Julius's work, but that was all. Eight days before the trial began her brother, under pressure from the prosecution, implicated Ethel in the sole act that would take her life  the typing of the notes. This, despite the fact, that up until then both Greenglasses had consistently asserted that the notes were handwritten. Years later, in a 1970s interview with author Ronald Radosh, the Greenglasses were hopelessly vague in remembering the typing incident, although they clearly remembered other events. Shocked to learn that it was the typing that gained Ethel the death penalty, Ruth said, """"It was almost as if we threw that in to involve her . . ."""" Again, you avoid all evidence contrary to your assertions, as if you ignoring it will make it disappear.  

 To state that """"their contributions to Soviet nuclear espionage were less important than was publicly alleged at the time"""" is to truly gild the lily. Julius's (not Ethel's) contribution was utterly useless, if not partly manufactured by the prosecution. The most damning piece of evidence against him was the drawing of the shaped charges, allegedly supplied to him by David Greenglass. Not only was this evidence absurd at the time, as one cannot reduce the information needed to a crude one-page sketch in any meaningful way, but the pertinent VENONA cable casts doubts that Greenglass ever presented the drawing at all (again, have you even read the transcripts? If so, why aren't they quoted?) Read VENONA #28, dated 8 Jan. 1945, then look to the timeline of the case as outlined by the prosecution. This cable covers the meeting at which Greenglass allegedly turned over the drawing to Julius, yet there is no mention of it at all. In the section where they detail what he has delivered (whi"

Last warnings that are more than a few days old are usually considered to have expired, unless it's evident from the edits that there is a pattern.

 :This address is registered to Truro College, Truro, England. I've tagged it as educational IP, it might belong to a classroom computer or even a school proxy. This means that 1. the IP won't be blocked long-term unless in extreme cases.

 :Make sure these kiddy IPs got one recent (at least the same day) serious warning.

However, you removed almost all of the information about the song, in effect """"sanitizing"""" it of all content, and the description you left of the song was NOT accurate.

 :::* The lyrics are not about a man being left along to take care of his children as you claimed.  The song is not simply a racialized version of """"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""""  it is a song fusing race-hatred, and sexual jealousy. The children appear in one line; the bulk of the lyrics focus on sex acts and a white man's disgust at  his ex-wife's intimacy with a """"greasy nigger.""""  

 ::*The information that you deleted and """"sanitized"""" out of existence is central to the song, and it is not """"POV"""" or """"unsupported claims"""" or about the """"song writer"""" as you claimed in your edit note.  

 :* Second, on your next edit, a few minutes later, you suddenly inserted the name of Shel Silverstein, a well known Jewish poet, author and children's book writer, as the """"co-author"""" of the racist song """"Nigger Fucker"""" by David Allan Coe. This literally came out of nowhere. If you did not intend it as vandalism, i must say that it certainly looked like it to me, especially as it was added after you had already """"sanitized"""" the description of the song and had described it falsely. 

 Your irresponsible action in adding Shel Silvestein to the page caused the editor Entheta, who had originally created the stub, to have to go to the Shel Silverstein talk page to get the information that cleared Silversein of your charge of collaborating in anti-black racism / satire (take your pick).  

 I reverted the page to the last pre-vandalized version.   

 You then reverted the article back to your first, half-deleted and """"sanitized"""", version which falsely claimed that the song was abou a """"jilted"""" husband who was left to care for his children.

 I wasn't sure how to respond to your message so I hope I am doing this right. You messaged me about my edits to the Greg Gianforte page. I am his son so I understand your concern and appreciate your message. I was aware of my biases and tried to be careful with my edits. My father is a controversial figure so there was already some charged language and misinformation on the page. I intentionally left in any information that casts my father in a negative light as long as it was true. I merely eliminated untrue, uncited statements (e.g. that his nickname is """"Baldy"""") and added balancing information to certain topics. For example, the only previous information about his charitable foundation was a single gift to a creationist museum; so I added general info about the foundation's scope and aim of benefiting education, protecting the vulnerable, etc. I did not remove the mention of the museum gift. I'm sure you will find that the article is more balanced and unbiased than before. If there are specific edits that you are concerned about, please let me know.

 == Disputed == 

 The idea of """"curb stomping"""" seems to be well-known primarily because of its inclusion in American History X.  It also seems there's a lot of urban lore about the practice.  I've seen a few references here and there to it occuring in real life, but can anyone provide some hard information on the subject?     

 I am an Australian and I have never heard of this practice being called a """"smiley"""" here.   Nathan 

 Check http://forums.comicbookresources.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&daysprune;=&f;=25 for numerous examples of how """"curbstomping"""" is used as a synonyme to """"completely dominating an opponent"""".   

 I first encountered curb stomping in the 1983 book """"Gardens of Stone"""" by Nicholas Proffitt. The incident was explicitly described, but I don't think it made it into the 1987 movie version. Anyone got an earlier reference?   

 Just because you haven't heard the term as """"smiley"""" doesn't mean that's not what it is. I have heard the term used as """"california smiley"""" quite a long time ago. It's probably an American  not an Australian  thing.

But we could say that the tensions are still high... and that practically, war still lasts. I'm not sure that there are 2,000,000 Albanians, I've heard that (and the 2.2) overestimate strictly from Albanian sources. And, if we return all the refugees, we would get a figure of almost 500,000 non-albanians (among whome 200,000-300,000 would be Serbs). There is also a fair amount of Albanians (Serbian sources claim even 100,000) that have nothing with Kosovo, but have migrated across the non-existent border division between Albania & Kosovo; the UN predicted a return of those people in 1999.  

 :You are right about the anti-UN feeling. In 2004 during the mass riot tens of UN peacekeeping units were killed and even more hurt. As a note to stop the negotiations, there were mass deminstrations this year. Search around wikipedia for """"Self-determination! movement"""", if memory serves me well, it has an article. They are drawing the limits, and seeing the UN as European colonists of the Americans, whereas the rest of the population (read: all peoples) openly consider the protectorate an occupation. It has nothing to do with the will of some people, but with the fact that the UN & NATO have done such a poor job on Kosovo in the last 6 years.  

 :Financial help from Serbia for Serbs is out of the question; the Kosovar transitional government demands that the investments should go to Pristina, and then elsewhere; they see Kosovo centralist & unified (no division - they won't do the same mistake like the Serbs).  

 :My thoughts are that when talking realistic, the best possible solution for Kosovo is sadly, some form of independence. I say sadly, because that will be the end of BiH one way or another (peaceful or a new war). 90% of the population of the Serb Republic don't want to have anything to do with the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and since the Bosniak leadership has learned to like the fact that it almost won the recent war, it's expectable that they will under no circumstance allow the Serbs' separation... And since the World is unlikely to support the Serbs, it seems as if war will be the last option (then again, we return to the very circle that almost no Bosnian wants war and that the world will stop it this time - so it's an endless loop of political intrigue). 

 :As for my personal opinions - well, they could be wrong. I'm generally for disintegration of states and always for unification. I think that we have to simply undo all the things that happened before, make it seem like they never happened, to further undermine their evildoers. This is why I support bringing a firm Constitution for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and abolishing all the entities; making it unified again. This is why I think that what the serbian side in the negotiations for Kosovo is almost right: high-level autonomy within Serbia. This is why I am satisfied with the new Constitution of Serbia giving higher autonomy to Vojvodina; and this is why I support the transitional Croatia-Bosnia-Serbia-Kosovo-Macedonia-Albania-Montenegro union. Hopefully, one day, Europe (and the whole world) will finally be clear of borders. This is the main reason why I never support creating any sort of new international political entities.

 I don't use Wikipedia much and I'm not very familiar with the protocols but after looking over the Notability page I believe that halo.bungie.org fits those requirements. It has been featured in national news articles on mroe then one occasion, the CBS articles on Video Game Violence is just the most recent.  The web page has well over 5,000 unique posters over it's entire lifetime and there are ten times that amount of viewers who don't post but lurk the site, solely for it's immense news database.  

 I noticed in the deletion debate someone said that Hbo didn't have an Alexa page, but it most definetly does.  
 According to Alexa it routinely hits a million plus page views, nearly everyday. Also, at special dates for Bungie Studios it can easily peak over 5 million page views. It's Alexa rating right now isn't under 10,000 but it has peaked at close to 6,000 if I'm reading the Alexa stats right and leading up to the release of the Halo Movie and Halo 3 it will most likely break 10,000 again.  

 Also, Hbo is up for VE's fansite of the year award.  and it raised over 10k for the Katrina relief through special edition Halo items with teh Blow Me Away auctions. 

 A side note, Bungie.org has many exclusive interviews with employees of Bungie Studios and has quite a few Heads Up from the developers that are easily noticible in the actual Halo 2 and Halo Pc game.  

 All these credentials seem to fit it into the requirements, maybe not exactly but it seems to me what it lacks is made up for in it's age and members."

76530e15b70c1bb4,"== Troy and the aminesian culture == 

 Troy is a city which existed over 4000 years and known as the centre of ancient civilizations. Many years, people believed that it was the city in tales and never existed until it was first found. At this time it was known as Ilium or New Ilium. But everyone knows the story of it. All the lost civilisations are known as aminesian cultures; e.g. the Atlantis. The aminesian culture is a culture (or civilization) which despite of the existence of several generations doesn't leave any traces and rarely appears in myths or legends (Atlantis and Plato's dialogues). It creates its own distinct and unique tradition but vanishing doesn't leave any heritage. Extermination of it is usually quite sudden and quick (e.g. disaster, epidemic, enemy invasion) which makes all its traces blurred and eventually vanished in oblivion (nevertheless sometimes some traces of A.C. appears later in myths or tales). It is unlikely but possible that some aminesian cultures can exists even today (some still unknown African or Amazonian tribes, perhaps?)."

 Comment  The paragraph lists two items countering the Sulkowicz claim: """"the man Sulkowicz accused responded by pointing out he had been cleared by the police and the school"""" and """"He also provided months of very friendly communications between him and Sulkowicz between the alleged assault and the accusation"""". Both items are true, but there is more against Sulkowicz.  

 The whole case boils down to she-said/he-said, which means trusting Sulkowicz.  Sulkowicz, though, has demonstrably been dishonest. For example, here is a video where Sulkowicz claims that the same man raped two other women; yet here is an article explaining that the other women claimed only (i) attempted forced kissing and (ii) emotional abuse in a relationship. That same article describes how Sulkowicz was almost certainly dishonest in describing how the university handled her reported rape. And here is another article detailing a further issue about the integrity of Sulkowicz's claims.  

 For me, the biggest reason to doubt that Sulkowicz was raped—and thus believe that the police and the university were correct in dismissing the case—is that it is a she-said/he-said case where she has been demonstrably dishonest. The suggested paragraph, however, does not make that clear at all. I am not an expert on Wikipedia policies, but suspect that by not fairly presenting one of the main reasons, the paragraph might be considered biased and thus violate BLP.    """

 ::Thanks! I appreciate the information leads! Is this report the last word on the Metabolite files? If so, your """"over 15,000 reports"""" was actually 14,459 """"computer files"""" - scanned fax pages, probably - which translated into a smaller number of """"reports"""" and an even smaller number of """"significant adverse effect"""" reports, covering a roughly 5-year period (1997-2002). According to the House report linked above, when they finished filing and categorizing everything it amounted to 1,985 reports of significant adverse effects, including 3 (yes, 3!) deaths. My calculation above suggests we should expect ~10 deaths per year (or 50 in 5), so these 3 are probably already accounted for in the existing odds. The newly-documented 42 hospitalizations and 82 emergency room visits also are within a rough order-of-magnitude of prior estimates.

While currently perceived in politically correct areas of the US as a derogatory term, it is still used by some as a collective descriptive. Albeit falling out of general use.

 The article appears generally neutral (but see below), stable, well-written and the one image is in order. Comments: 
 * The use of the word """"exiled"""" appears contentious. To a lay person that implies politically (or even militarily) hostile ejection of a person from their country. This does not appear to be on that level; nor does it appear to be ejection from their country, but from one territory to another within a country.

 * """"The public and academic reaction to the decision was a negative one"""": this is followed by a quote, but not a cite to make clear who is being quoted. 
 * The article doesn't seem to say anything about final effects. Eg, were there Chagossians who had returned and were now again relocated? I'm assuming not. Any other effects? Apologies, alternative arrangements offered by governments, any announcement from the Chagossian refugee group?

ca0161a69ec6baf9,"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis   

  

  
 Definition 

 Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is a viral infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord and of the cerebrospinal fluid. 

 Description 

 Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection is relatively rare and recovery usually occurs spontaneously within a couple of weeks. Many cases are probably not even identified because the symptoms range from extremely mild to those resembling severe flu. A few patients develop symptoms of meningitis. In some rare cases, the LCM viral infection can spread throughout the central nervous system, and may even be fatal. 

 Causes and symptoms 

 LCM is caused by an arenavirus, which is an RNA virus and is a mild cousin in the family containing the much more threatening arenaviruses that cause hemmorrhagic fever. Humans acquire LCM virus from infected rodents by coming in contact with the animals or their excretions. Exposure to the virus is not as unlikely to occur as it seems, because the viral hosts can be common house mice and even pets, such as hamsters and chinchillas. Most cases of LCM occur in fall and winter, when mice seek warmth inside dwellings. Food and dust can become contaminated by the excretions of rodents infected with LCM virus. In 1997, French scientists alerted physicians to suspect LCM viral infection in people who had contact with Syrian hamsters. 

 The symptoms of LCM occur in two phases. The first (prodrome) stage can produce fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, and vomiting. In the second phase, characteristic meningitis symptoms of headache, stiff neck, listlessness, and nausea and vomiting may occur. In adults, complications are rare and recovery may even occur before the second phase. 

 The virus is not spread from person to person, except through pregnancy. LCM virus is one of the few viruses that can cross the placenta from mother to child during pregnancy and may be an underrecognized cause of congenital infection in newborns. Infection with cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii,or LCM virus can appear similar enough in infants to be confused when diagnosed. In cases that have been recognized among infants, LCM viral infection has a high mortality rate (about one-third of the babies studied died). 

 Diagnosis 

 LCM can be distinguished from bacterial meningitis by the history of prodrome symptoms and the period of time before meningitis symptoms begin, which is about 15-21 days for LCM. 

 Treatment 

 No antiviral agents exist for LCM virus. Treatment consists of supporting the patient and treating the symptoms until the infection subsides, generally within a few weeks."

 There are some POV concerns that the use of Wikipedia's voice of authority is being used to attempt to balance information in a non-encyclopedic manner by presenting ony directly equal space to both critcism of the church and the church's response using only primary examples in an overly POV manner to chop down a well sourced section far beyond what is being discussed on the talk page. So to adapt what has already there I would like to at least state what I don't have a problem with. I don't have a real problem with the Packer information NOT being it's own section. I don't have a problem with the full quotes being removed from the prose, HOWEVER as this is a publication of the printed statements of Mormon doctrine and I am seeing a use of primary source material as only mentioned in an opinion peice in Ensign from a church leader that I believe had a hand in writing.

In her book The King's Bedpost: Reformation and Iconography in a Tudor Group Portrait (1994, p. 72), Margaret Aston compares the iconoclastic scene to prints depicting the destruction of the Tower of Babel (Philip Galle after Maarten van Heemskerck, 1567).

Despite what your sources say, the Pentarchy did not suddenly spring up into existence in 451 when the Monophysite Patriarchs were deposed and replaced with Roman lackeys.  And Jerusalem was THE original Patriarchate since James the Just, it did not suddenly become a Patriarchate in 451 when a Vatican pretender was appointed alongside the real one.

490f369b3ef52b7c,"great & i am glad of our mutual understanding 

 & would answer your question that the jog may be more illusory than real  

 or more mental than physical 

 for any expressible meridian is technically not a sharp line but rather the band sometimes quite narrow of the delimitation of its own expression 

 so a meridian expressed as crudely as just some integral degree of longitude like say the hundredth meridian could be understood & until recently preferred to be understood as a band of longitude with a width of 1 degree or say many km even in northern canada 

 & if you express your meridian in degminsecplus5 youll get a submillimetrically wide or rather truly narrow band which is for all practical purposes as thin as a line yet still is not a line but a band at the bandwidth of your command 

 but coarsen your expression to degminsecplus3 & your band will be fatter than a tape measure 

 & if you express it in just plain degmin then your band is a mile wide  

 & if you do that without giving a datum then your mile wide band is roughly redoubled in width 

 & thats precisely or imprecisely what the enabling text creates 

 it stipulates noncontradictorily a marker that stands within the stated bandwidths of longitude & latitude & it doesnt pretend to any more exactitude than to say something very clearly in two distinct but equally clear ways 
 albeit that one of these ways could have been misunderstood to contradict rather than confirm & be reaffirmed by the other 

 so since marker 157 does indeed fall within that nicely & not at all clumsily stated neck of the woods we already have a lock on a de jure quadripoint whether ntnu is ever surveyed or not 

 nor is this text unique in expressing the location of a monument so apparently crudely 

 far from it 

 this happens all the time as you yourself have remarked in several ways 

 & the only jog that is needed in such a case is to jog the mind into realizing that the stated terms actually are a perfect mutual lock & no miss at all 

 & yes technology has come a long way but only a very short distance in survey art since the 1960s

953e5ff8d0bc2728,"Proposal II === 

 Ok, here's my take on this.  I agree that there should be at least one person who keeps an eye on all thing related to Barack Obama.  However, looking at everything above, all I can say is that it is way to complicated.  All those rules, regs, etc still leave many things open to interpretation, gaming, and continual confusion.  My belief is in the acronym: K.I.S.S. or Keep It Simple Stupid!.  The simpler things are, the easier they are to understand, leaving less to interpretation/gaming/etc.   

 So here is my proposal: Instead of having chairs, councils, etc, we just have Moderators.  We have at least three moderators. Each acts on their own unless one steps over the line and then it is either the other moderators or admins who will deal with the moderator.  The moderator's job will be: 
 # To make sure the the discussions on the talk pages are on the content of the article and nothing more. 
 # To make sure there is no personal attacks, sockpupptery, obvious POV pushing, or other breaking of wiki policies/rules/etc. 
 # To remain neutral and not to participate other then to settle disputes. 
 # To enforce all rules agreed upon and also to take sanctions out on people violating the agreed upon rules that include warnings and temp bans.   

 We would elect these moderators and they would stay here throughout the election period.  After the election period, we can decide upon where to keep it going after that.   

 There is probably more to this, but I can't think of it right now.  Any thoughts, etc?

 Change from: 
 Nikola Tesla was born on 10 July (O.S. 28 June) 1856 to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). 

 To: 
 Nikola Tesla was born on 10 July (O.S. 28 June) 1856 to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan, Croatia , Austrian Empire. 

 Reason: 

 First, we have a direct quote from Tesla: """"I was born in Croatia"""". 
 Source: 
 Tribute to King Alexander 
 Nikola Tesla 
 Published in New York Times, Oct. 19, 1934 

 Furthermore, the above construct suggests a different thesis. That Tesla was not born in Croatia, but that he was born on the land that would later become Croatia.  

 Tesla's birth place was at that time in the Military zone, made from Croatian land that was under administration of the Empire. However Military zone was not a political subject. It's an militarized area made for protection from Ottomans. Not to go deeper into classification of the Military zone, i will only mention that in 1881. Military zone was returned to Croatia. That is somehow a confirmation of my claim, that Military zone was Croatian land.  

 I think that i made my point. Tesla was born in Croatia, just as he himself stated.

b6234dc2dd2f32b8,"==Touching the eye== 
 I have added a paragraph to the Insertion and Removal section discussing one aspect of contact lens use that is not mentioned. And that is in order to actually be able to use contacts, one has to learn to overcome the instinct that prevents us from touching our eyeballs with our fingers or other objects. It's separate from the blink reflex (though related). I do not believe this to be OR to include this. Aside from the fact there are few sources cited in the section anyway, it's common knowledge that one must train to put contact lenses in and remove them (this is reflected later in the section), and this includes overcoming the hesitency against touching the eyeball. I do know there are people who simply cannot do it (I saw a percentage listed somewhere) and thus cannot wear contacts; I happen to fall into that demographic. I attempted to wear contacts a few years back but abandoned it because I was unable to overcome the hesitancy."
00a02064e4c420d3,"==Identity of monarchs?== 

 The article on Arbella Stuart mentions — but does not identify by name — a Duke of Parma, a Pope, a cardinal who was the Pope's brother, as well as the kings of France, Spain and Poland. I want to identify and make links for the Pope, cardinal and kings mentioned in the article. 

 My sketchy memory of the names of European leaders of the late 16th and early 17th centuries makes me ask these questions: 

 :Is the King of France Henry IV? 
 :Is the King of Spain Philip III? 
 :Is the Pope Clement VIII? Did he have a brother who was a cardinal? Was that cardinal really defrocked in order to marry Arbella Stuart? 
 :And who are the Duke of Parma and King of Poland mentioned in the article?

 == Empty Weight == 

 A recent edit revised the empty weight to 12000kg citing a EF-world mag that quoted a Zero Fuel Weight or ZFW. It is my understanding that this is not only by definition not the same as """"empty weight"""" or """"operational empty weight"""" or """"Manufacturer's empty weight"""" but dependent on the configuration being considered.  

 My guess is that 12t is rounded down from the weight with some AAMs (what... 6+2 say, as quoted in the article). That's the best I can think of for now but the most important thing is that the 12000kg doesn't even claim to be the """"empty weight"""" that we're trying to quote. Adding a """"Air-Air Typical ZFW"""" figure would be fine by me of course, it's all very interesting. I have made it 11150 because that's what Janes says. 

 Elsewhere on the Eurofighter.com site it says 11000kg, so I (for my own benefit) make the assumption, until a better one arrives, that 11000 is the MEW and 11150 is the OEW that is, plus pilot, various oil and hydraulic fluid and so on. If someone knows better that's great please enlighten me, but the 12000kg figure isn't right.  

 I also changed the conversion to pounds, which ironically made the pounds number go UP from where it had been, and not DOWN... this is just silly. I have used the formula 1 lb = 0.454kg so thats good to the nearest gram. Again, if someone wants to look up better, that's awesome but this is from (my reasonably effective memory.

 Hi Piotrniz, Thank you for your attempts to improve articles.  It appears that you are adding unsourced original research and interpretations to the article on Free Will, and sometimes editing without logging in to your account.  Please log in before editing.   

 I reverted one of your edits on the Free Will article because it was unsourced and changed the meaning of the paragraph.  Reverting edits is not at all personal, and I would be happy to discuss the proposed edit further.  It appears that you re-reverted the edit without logging in.  I would like to discuss the edit.  

 Here is my explanation.  The common argument for a conflict between an omniscient being, such as God, and Free Will takes the following form:  If God knows everything that is going to happen, then how can I be free to choose what will happen.  This argument is not about injunctions or morality.  It is about a potential conflict between definite knowledge of the future and freedom to change the future.  Perhaps we can work together to make this point more clear in the article?

As to the Habsburg empire, during the middle ages, similar empires also existed: the empire of the Luxembourg dynasty (Bohemia, Hungary, Luxemburg), the empire of the Jagello dynasty (Poland, Bohemia, Lithuania, Hungary). All these empires had their own institutions (at least the king and his council), but nobody claims that they lost their own independence. Yes, the union of the realms and the provinces within the Habsburg Empire formed a political union, because they were governed by the same monarchs and there were some common institutions, but each realms and provinces reserved their own constitutional institutions: e.g., the Habsburg kings could not levy tax without the consent of the Diet, the viceroy (the Palatine) was elected by the Diet, the Diet passed the act that ensured the succession of the female line of the Habsburgs. In the course of the 17th century, the Habsburg kings made peaces with the Estates of the Kingdom of Hungary and even in 1711 they had to accept a compormise that ensured the constitutional (although in some territories, only limited) independence of the Kingdom of Hungary. Even the Habsburg kings of Hungary, could not grant offices and estates to their partisans living in their other realms in the Kingdom of Hungary, without the consent of the Estates. I accept that the Kingdom of Hungary did not enjoy the same level of independence from the 17th century, than it had enjoyed before, but Hungary and Slovakia lost the control over several field of law when they joined the EU, but, I presume, both of them are still independent countries with their own independent constitutional institutions."

1cb45d2bbc74676a,"Okay. Makes sense to me as the pressure group ‘July 7 truth Campaign’ who are very keen to include the new inserts I find most difficult to debate with. Here is how I see it as (a) the original author and (b) someone who has since met Power (who is reluctant to be involved in this matter): 

 The original article and attachments I researched were I hope, accurate and relevant.  Not inspired by any hidden agenda. I was also grateful for a bit of Wikipedia help in the finished work. I also believe anything in this or any Wikipedia article should be not biased or linked to gratuitously antagonistic sources that only want to pursue their own cause.  With these thoughts in mind two questions are now asked: 

 1. Is the final paragraph appropriately sourced?  
 2. Are any/all the external links suitable? 

 The final paragraph is indisputably from an organisation that is pursuing a personal and hostile vendetta against Power. Numerous websites confirm this. Indeed, the author does not hide the fact.  I find it impossible to accept that any paragraph submitted by this group can be unbiased or not linked to antagonistic sources and a hidden agenda. But are these issues alone sufficient to doubt the source and suitability?  

 1. Is the final paragraph appropriately sourced?  I consider the source has to be weighed against the relevance of the paragraph? What was or might have been reported in a provincial newspaper almost a lifetime ago is not in itself an immediate point of challenge, although it could be. The substance however, is even less newsworthy than say someone who is found not guilty of a minor traffic offence. Power in this sense, was never charged, summonsed or even disciplined. I can confirm from the subject of the article that the CPS did indeed decide that no prosecution was required for an internal/administration matter. However, Power was a senior police officer which meant a full enquiry whenever any allegation is made was bound to occur, even though no charges were ever brought. But the local paper thought his rank merited comment. Otherwise, it was not in the least newsworthy.  Within the context of an accurate and relevant article I believe this deliberately selective use of an otherwise distant and pointless news item is intended only to harm Power to suit the organisation that discovered it.  Had they looked further there are other newspaper features over the years that tell of Powers awards for gallantry and leadership, but of course these do not support the reason why the ‘July 7 truth campaign’ want to publish this particular and I believe (at best) irrelevant paragraph.  

 2. Are any/all the external links suitable? Probably the ones that for many months linked to the wider exploits of Power and were not specifically selective, are suitable.  They have never been challenged as they are from various sources without any hidden agenda.  For example, those linked to all the BBC sites who have reported on Power’s previous actions - without bias.  Now suddenly a hostile pressure group with a well known and personal vendetta against Power wants to promote itself by inserting its own external link. I suggest this is neither accurate nor relevant and seeks only to manipulate Wikipedia to promote a single course. 

 Since the eponymously called  ‘July 7 truth Campaign’ has a keen interest in promoting its own view that nothing so far, has been truthfully reported about the tragedy in 2005, can I suggest they consider adding to the already very well covered article on that event, rather than be allowed to conduct a campaign of what appears to be character assignation far removed from anything that is accurate or relevant to the readers of Wikipedia.    It seems from other contributors that I am not alone in this view. 

 I ask that the final paragraph and external link that now exists be removed and we revert to what was previously published."

1cf05d36f1184fdd,"""== Merge from Jill Pike == 

 Jill Pike's article has demonstrated no independent notability.   

 :Now she's an ABC News commentator which is independent to the Young Turks.   

 == Jill Pike Status == 
 Jill Pike is no longer a co-host of the """"The Young Turks"""" talk-show, but is still member of team. Cenk Uygur has stated this many times on air, and on """"The Absolute Truth"""" show.   

 == General Cleanup == 
 This article as it stands is just a bunch of random facts, many about former co-hosts. It should at least be broken into sections, if not all together rewritten.   

 :I did a lot of writing and re-writing of the sections.  It could use a lot of other edits i'm sure, but what I did should be a start.     

 == Political leanings == 

 Should there be more made of the political leanings of the show?  In general they are pushing democratic party/progressive/liberal views, and attacking the republicans/right wingers/neocons and Cenk makes no attempt to hide when he was shilling for Obama, he seems quite happy to talk about that. I think this would be in line with the treatment of other propagandists in talk like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh    

 :Someone has noted """"Liberal"""" at the top of the description (Citation Needed) so I assume that covers it. Like the wingnuts on """"Faux"""" he is providing viewpoint, so that seems like the """"liberal """" tag is fair enough (Agree tho' that the citation to outside source is needed) My only hesitation is that from """"Old-Style"""" definitions, he actually calls himself a """"moderate"""" (Centrist orientation) But the """"Noveau-Reich"""" have so polluted the Language & twisted definitions that there may not really BE a """"center"""" any-more. When Jokers like O-reilly keep confusing meanings of words by lying about being """"independant"""" -(So that then the vast unwashed right wingers THINK that a moderate is someone who holds those unsupported extremist viewpoints...) Cenk has stated many times that he believes in a 2 party system, & sometimes speaks favorably of some """"Common Sense """" republican positions. (He's a former Republican himself & holds some libertarian views) But since those are few & far between anymore... I guess that pushes empirical thinkers into being """"Labeled"""" as """"liberal"""" and there's no avoiding it. -Sigh- Makes me miss Gerald Ford sometimes. Or the original john McCain. (before the 2000 debacle in the GOP) Oh well. As it is, the article seems enough. The """"Young Turk"""" Reference is good. There WAS an original split in the Young Turk movement between """"Young Turk Reformers"""" who believed that the Armenians should be included; granted citizenship & Rights in Turkey Verses the Nationalist/militaristic """"Young Turks """" who eventually spearheaded the Armenian Massacre. So It fits the Inclusive views of the show.    -mbd-   

 ::By international standards I'd say he's roughly neutral, but by American standards he is definitely 'liberal' despite the contradiction in terms in American political parlance. But most importantly, this is wikipedia, a place for sources and not conjecture. So find a source that is reliable etc. etc. and put the information in the article if you really want it.

It means the deleter is removing everything done by a person without discriminating and evaluating the respective merits of each particular edition. That is hostile editing. 
 :::By chance I check a page while reading a book. I note that it is totally out of sync with wiki criteria and practices, and in many places full of poor sources and dubious material. I make one edit, it suffers a total revert, ostensibly about genetics, but removing everything else, on yiddish from one of the world's foremost authorities (one position among several as I began to edit in relevant material). Shrike arrives, Jethro arrives, NMMGG arrives, and, saying nothing of the lamentably phrased, incoherent edits by Tritomex, you all passively back him by kibitzing on the talk page. That behaviour, over dozens of pages, is not neutral. It is a disturbing pattern, and means that people like myself cannot trust the 'community' to enter a page and analyse all behaviour in terms of policy and the merits of each specific edit without regard to who is editing. I am profiled, I assume, as 'anti-Jewish', and therefore need a cohort of control? It's a bloc partisan behavioural pattern. Tritomex knows nothing of the subjects treated because the sources he adduces are all web sites or googled according to need. All of that crap he put in yesterday is stale, or useless, or contained in an excellent monograph published this year by Toch who dismisses much of the reportage in those JVL sources as erroneous deductions from Church fantasies about the Jews. Archeology is what counts, or direct report from Jewish sources, not Christian sources, which are often suspect because of their need for raising the spectre of Jewish threats. All over Byzantium, the mediterranean littoral and Italy the Jewish presence is attested by epitaphs and synogogue remains. There is almost nothing of this in the north until very late.

Granted, in that example, the US bombed itself, and Afghan allies, but we don't have an info box presenting the accident as a civil war between US forces. Until it is shown that the US deliberately marched into Pakistan with the intent of killing Pakistani government forces, then we are creating a bogus article by representing this as a """"conflict"""".

 ::Prokaryotes do fine without it, but they also have two outter membranes. The inner of the two takes on many of the functions of eukaryotic membrane-bound organelles such as the golgi.  Many of the eukaryotic proteins found in the golgi that embed proteins in the membrane are homologous to proteins found in the inner membranes of prokaryotes.  So in a sense prokaryotes do have a golgi, or at least something functionaly similar.  Erythrocytes, like Seraphine said, have no golgi nor most other organelles for that matter.  They are pretty much gutted before being released into the blood.  But I think even this is pretty rare for eukaryotes.  Most species' red blood cells get to keep their nuclei and various other entrails. (Mommy always said I was special.  I guess she was refering to my lack of nuclei)  But, for the most part eukaryotes need their golgis. Cells need a steady flow of proteins moving to the membrane, which, for all of us """"higher"""" species, means we need our precious golgis. So I guess Seraphine said it best...

 I just took an undergraduate module on general biology and am extremely fascinated by this Golgi apparatus. But unfortunately very little information is available in the textbook - it seems Wikipedia has more info! However, I think it would be helpful if we knew what exactly are the major areas of the Golgi apparatus that remain unknown: Are the transport systems (to and fro) fully understood? How are the vesicles formed? Are the metabolic processes all described? Is there a list of the proteins which are synthesised/modified at the Golgi? 

 And btw, what does """"a multi joined membrane-bound accumulation"""" mean? Is that the way biologists describe such structures?

It's comprehensive enough now based on book coverage but the prose is still not exactly """"brilliant"""". I think with a bit of polish we can keep it there though. I've seen the film now. My only major criticism though would be that it implies that it is something of a masterpiece in the themes section, but it was pretty trashy, not a spot on Suspiria. That's just my humble opinion of course..♦   

 Sandy, how is Shah Rukh Khan looking to you now? I think it's ready, I think RHM22 does too. It still didn't get the peer review input I was hoping for though. People just seem turned off by him, right ? If you think it's ready, we'll renominate. ♦   
 : The last time I looked at it, I didn't see anything serious enough to indicate it wasn't FAC worthy ...    
 ::Thanks.♦   
 :::If people are turned off by him, it's only because they haven't seen any of his films yet, haha. Anyway, thanks Sandy.  |  """

 Tenek are the first band on this compilation. Surely that is a valid link? And if not, why not? It's not written by them, it is an verifiable independent link. 

 I've had a look at some other wiki pages to get an idea what is allowed and what is not, for example the Andi Fraggs page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andi_Fraggs (he's on tour with Tenek at the moment supporting Toyah) and in his references there is a link for example to his bio on his OWN web page - why is that allowed?

20c7ff2871837cd8,"""WINNIPEG FOLK FESTIVAL 2005 
 by John Benson 

 We stepped foot on the campground at about 7:00am. Once we reached the end of Trailhead 1 we paused for a quick moment and looked out at what was before us. During this time, Dick took a deep breath in, smiled, and exclaimed """"Ah! Folk Fest!"""" This was my first time attending this crazy festival, and after only the first 10 seconds I knew I was in for one Hell of a memorable weekend. We had driven all night long to get here as early as possible. Who were """"we"""", you ask? Well, we were a strange mix of individuals with loose connections to one another. 

 There was, of course, me. Next, we had Dick. Dick had worked as a cook at Strawberry's before I was hired there in July 2002. Dick owned The Melvin House, which is a house notorious for its parties and its interesting blend of visitors. It was the kind of house you could just show up to at any time of day and, as long as you knew someone there and you weren't terribly annoying, you were welcome to stay for a few drinks or hit of weed. You could even stay for supper, as long as you did your fair share of the cleanup afterward. The general rule was that you respect the privacy of those who lived there, you take out what you bring in, and you respect the property. Anyone who could abide by these rules and who didn't overstay their welcome could drop by during any reasonable hour of the day and just relax with whoever else was there. This system worked better than you might think. Everyone got along, and nobody got the place into any trouble. This paved the way for some monumentally successful parties around New Year's and July 1st. 

 Also part of the Folk Fest crew that year was Bev, whom I'd worked with quite frequently at the 'berry. And, finally, there was Tedray. Tedray was by far the standout member of our group. While Dick, Bev, and myself were all within a year of each other in our early-to-mid twenties, Tedray was 50-something. He was also a Caribbean immigrant. Blacker than the dead of night. His long black hair was quickly going gray. He wore it in loose dreadlocks that hung almost to the ground. He spoke with an extremely thick reggae-type accent. He not only stood out among our group of four - he stood out among everyone at the festival. On top of it all, he was by far the most outgoing and social of us all. This was a blessing. In large part thanks to Tedray, our small group of tents became the centre of attention on Friday night. I'll get to that... 

 Getting to Folk Fest was a bit of a fluke in itself. First of all, as late as Thursday afternoon, we didn't have our tickets, which had already been paid for and were supposed to have arrived. The plan was to leave The Melvin House after Dick got off work Thursday, drive overnight and pitch our tents bright and early Friday morning before the Sun came up and scorched us. I got to The Melvin House sometime in the afternoon on Thursday and sat around in the living room chatting with a few others about the upcoming weekend. Some of them had gone previous years, and they all had positive things to say about their experiences. I was getting psyched just thinking about it. Dick showed up after not too long and asked if Paco had shown up with the tickets yet. Paco's real name is Anthony (I'm not sure why everyone calls him Paco), and he was a cook at Strawberry's. We had all given him our money for the festival and camping passes with the understanding that he would put it all on his credit card. Paco didn't plan to go that year, but for some reason it was easiest to have him buy the tickets. Maybe he had a Ticketmaster account or something. I'm not sure. Well, Paco had not shown up, and repeated calls to his cellphone had gone unanswered. Dick starts to worry. I held my cool, figuring everything would sort itself out. A few hours later, maybe around 9:00pm or so, Bev shows up at The Melvin House. """"Can anyone get ahold of Paco?"""" To relieve the tension that was quickly building up, we all sat down and passed around a few joints. It was approaching 10:00pm now, and we were dreading having to either postpone the festival by a day, or worse yet, a year. Soon enough, lights flood into the living room.

1cb26b886407d8eb,"""== REMOVED ABUSE SECTION == 

 I removed the whole section relating to the alleged abuse (see WP:BLP). Having read both sources, there is NOTHING to say that he was physically abusive. While her attorneys have described it as an """"abusive relationship"""", and Lee has said various uncomplimentary things about Moody, there is no way we can definitively state he was physically and emotionally abusive. The most that should be included is a note about the attorney's description of the relationship, and possibly some quotes from Lee.   

 Based on all the videos and interviews I've seen, it was Amy that treated Ben like shit so if Ben was involved in any physical/emotional abuse, in my opinion, it was Amy who brought it on herself in the first place.  On the other hand, the fact that Ben was dealing with severe depression and couldn't do a damn thing without having a drink or popping some pills for a long period of time leads me to believe that he is in fact the abuser she is talking about.  I can't say with absolute certainty that that's the case, but I believe they both are at fault for what happened then and also lead him to leave the band.  So to sum up - Amy treated Ben like crap in most of the vids I've seen of them together and Ben finally had enough and fought back.  I'm on Ben's side although I don't agree with him physically abusing her if that is what happened.  Maybe she was trying to beat the hell out of him first and he was just defending himself.  I do know that when Amy was asked point blank if Ben was the abuser she was referring to in the infamous Blender interview, she sharply sucked in her breath and bit her lip.  Why would she do that if Ben wasn't the abuser?

 There might be similarities, but what you are doing is undermining the term religion. You say: A, B and C are religions because they have these specific characteristics. Then you say: although these things right here (let's call them X, Y and Z) don't have the above characteristics (that make A, B and C into religions), they still are religions. Do you see the paradox? 
 All I'm saying is that you can't use the term religion for Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. if you simultaneously use it for Christianity and such. You undermine the meaning of the word if you do so. It seems to me like you use an awfully broad concept of the term. By doing so, you eliminate all meaning from it. Further, you run the risk of classifying many things that have absolutely nothing to do with religion, as a """"religion"""". 
 I just took a class on """"Buddhism"""" at my university by an Indian professor. He taught us the above by means of the book he wrote (see the reference to Balagangadhara in my previous post). He said the West started this farce of calling Buddhism and all a """"religion"""" and what's even more sad is that most of the Indians themselves are continuing this farce even today. He also taught us though, that, from the viewpoint, the religous background (cfr. Reformation) and understanding of the world of the missionaries who started the farce, it is perfectly understandable that they did so. Religions can't see """"otherness"""", can't see different things that they are different in a """"different"""" way, but can only recognize false variations of themselves.  
 Pretty interesting class it was. Throughout his book he told about Roman times, the Reformation period, Enlightment period, what the missionaries' expectations were before going to India, how the missionaries frame of mind was fitted onto Indian culture, how both sides misinterpreted eachother etc. By doing so he explained HOW the situation today came to be. And to tell you, it is indeed perfectly understandable from both the Western ánd the Indian viewpoint. It is an unfortunate collusion of misunderstandings and accidents. I can really recommend the book. [30 June 2005 10:41h] Dries."""

In this sense they (global scenario) can arouse all the euphoria that they want and raise all the monies for what ever they have seen as  patterns of  yearly destruction and how to repair and prevent it.  Enough of erroneous science. True science will take its course later... after accurate experimentation have been done."""

However, I do think that the quote is notable. The main evidence of this is Treasurer Swan's use of the word 'reckless' in the Laurie Oakes interview: 
 :TREASURER: Well, the most important thing we've got to do from a national level is to show some leadership by the national Government which is to get rid of reckless spending. That's why we said during the campaign, we would make savings of $10 billion and that's why we've set ourselves the objective of making further savings through this budget process. You see, we are seeing almost daily evidence of reckless spending from the former government. Only yesterday Mr Turnbull admitted that he increased a grant to a friend, five times, originally recommended to him at $2 million, and given to the recipient at $10 million. That era of reckless spending is over. We need a new era of fiscal discipline and that is what the Rudd Government is determined to put in place so we can play our role in tackling inflation and taking some of the pressure off the Reserve Bank.  
 :(emphasis mine). This was an interview after the election, it is clear that the quote informed their immediate post-election policy; it was not a throw-away line. Swann says getting rid of reckless spending is """"the most important thing"""" they had to do. (Actually, this might also be worth including in the Wayne Swan article).

And it attributes the lesser binding energy to the coulomb repulsion. And that would indicate the 3He3 nuclide to be the larger.

 *Guest activity increased in July. Questions are up from an average of 36 per week in June to 43 per week in July, and guest profile creation has also increased. This is likely a result of the automatic invite experiments we started near the end of month, which seeks to lessen the burden on hosts and other volunteers who manually invite editors. During the last week of July, questions doubled in the Teahouse!  (But don't let that deter you from inviting editors to the Teahouse, please, there are still lots of new editors who haven't found Teahouse yet.) 
 *More Teahouse hosts than ever. We had 12 new hosts sign up to participate at the Teahouse! We now have 35 hosts volunteering at the Teahouse. Feel free to stop by and see them all here.  
 *Phase two update: Host sprint. In August, the Teahouse team plans to improve the host experience by developing a simpler new-host creation process, a better way of surfacing active hosts, and a host lounge renovation. Take a look at the plan and weigh in here. 
 *New Teahouse guest barnstar is awarded to first recipient: Charlie Inks. Using the Teahouse barnstar designed by , hosts  and  created the new Teahouse Guest Barnstar. The first recipient is , for her boldness in asking questions at the Teahouse. Check out the award in action . 
 *Teahouse was a hot topic at Wikimania! The Teahouse was a hot topic at Wikimania this past month, where editor retention and interface design was heavily discussed.  and  presented the Teahouse during the Wikimedia Fellowships panel. Slides can be viewed here. A lunch was also held at Wikimania for Teahouse hosts.

 ==Comalcalco Brick discussion (moved from your front page)== 
 Senor Cuete, 

 Originally I wrote this for the discussion page on the 2012 Phenomenon, but it seems more appropriate to write you directly first. 

 RE: """"Comalcalco brick is a hoax."""" 

 What evidence do you have that the brick is a """"hoax."""" Are you suggesting that the Mexican officials made mention of the brick as a publicity stunt? To what end, as INAH officials have consistently downplayed any suggestion that the ancient Maya gave any special significance to the end of the 13th baktun? 

 You write, Erik Boot """"blew it."""" Again, why such strong language? According to the Gronemeyer and MacLeod that you yourself cite, Boot """"tentatively"""" translated the date as 13.0.0.0.0. And where did you get your information that he planned to recant his translation? Personal knowledge? Wikipedia isn't the place for it. 

 Look carefully at how Gronemeyer and MacLeod describe Marc Zender's translation: """"However, Marc Zender (w.c., 17th Jul 2010) has shown that the ak’ab element in its month name ARGUES against it being the head variant of K’ank’in ... He ALTERNATIVELY suggests Xul and Suutz’ and proposes a date 9.16.18.5.0, 4 Ajaw 3 Xul."""" The emphasized words in all caps are mine. You'll note that the wording is respectful and unlike your comments, do not reflect stone-cold certainty. 

 With 2012 being such an explosive and controversial subject, I respectfully suggest as that you temper your language and leave out the hyperbole. Obviously you have strong feelings about this subject. I read your initial posting of your most recent response and see you toned down the language, but there is much remaining that is not only inflammatory, it mischaracterizes the issue or represents your opinion stated as fact. 

 Please note that I am not advocating mention of the Comalcalco brick in this Wikipedia article. The publicity about it appears to have originated from a Mark Stevenson article for the Associated Press, and I have already gone on the record saying that newspaper articles can be unreliable. I assume that Stevenson learned about the brick from the INAH notice of the Palenque Roundtable, which mentioned the brick in passing. According to Stevenson, """"Arturo Mendez, a spokesman for the institute, said the fragment of inscription had been discovered years ago and has been subject to thorough study."""" I somewhat doubt that, and as Mendez is not an archaeologist but a PR representative, I cannot accept him as a legitimate source. As I write this the Palenque Round Table is underway, and I'm certain that the brick will be discussed. Erik Boot is supposed to be there, so he will have the opportunity to revise his translation or defend it in front of his peers. He shouldn't have to defend himself on Wikipedia. Saludos.   """

In the article for UNC, you will note that the ROK relinquished command of its military forces to UNC early in the war.  (This statement is unreferenced.)  Thus, the military of SK (ROKA) was bound by the armistice.  The armistice itself asked or projected that the governments of the parties would begin peace talks in the near future, but this did not occur.  In any event, the fighting was stopped by means of a document (e.g., legal document) that was binding to the parties.  The war had ended."

 A building is named by its owner.  Upon change of title, the new owner can change the name to whatever it wants.  That's the way naming works.  The Sears Tower in Chicago was purchased by Willis Insurance and renamed """"The Willis Tower"""", and that is how it is found in Wikipedia. This cathedral is properly named """"Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción"""" - in English Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption.

Those arguing for bastardised names such as """"Cathedral-mosque"""" or """"Mesquita"""" are actually pushing a political agenda, even while trying to justify their preference as artistic or historical. This building is not a great architectural masterpiece.  It's significant because it was recaptured from the Muslims and an indelible Christian cathedral was stamped right in the middle of it.  At the same time, its new name was carved into stone: """"Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción"""". Until it's recaptured by some other faction, it should be known by the name given to it by its present owners, helped along by masses of WP redirects if necessary.    """

It seems that a variety of events happened in the South Island about 1450ish which drove Maori to migrate-some to the North Island and some to the Chathams. We are finding out more about the """"1450"""" events every year. An underlying cause may have been climate change. Other likely causes were earthquakes and Tsunamis.

 May we please consider the matter bit by bit?  This discussion section has got enormously long.  Let's start with the definition of """"Catholic Church hierarchy"""", before considering whether other matters need to be dealt with in the lead, rather than in the body of the article.  I would suggest opening the article as follows: 

 :The Catholic Church hierarchy consists of those members of the Catholic Church who are in holy orders, as the Council of Trent definitively stated: """"If any one saith, that, in the Catholic Church there is not a hierarchy by divine ordination instituted, consisting of bishops, priests, and ministers; let him be anathema.""""Council of Trent, session XXIII, canon VI on the sacrament of Order Accordingly, the Catechism of the Catholic Church distinguishes the Church's membership as belonging exclusively either to the hierarchy or to the laity.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 873 
 :However, the term """"hierarchy"""" is also commonly, even if unofficially, used to refer to the bishops alone, excluding the priests (presbyters) and deacons.""""Hierarchy"""" in John Hardon, Modern Catholic Dictionary 

 If we can agree on that or some modification of it, we can then insert it into the article and afterwards go on to discuss the many other questions you are raising, such as your claim that the magisterium means """"defining dogma"""".  Defining dogma is, I would say, a """"supreme magisterium"""" (cf. CCC 891) that the college of bishops (including its head) exercise from time to time; but they exercise a vastly wider magisterium every day.  Let us leave until later that and all the other questions you are raising.

 ==Request for comment== 

 As described by earlier discussion in this talk page, the debate is where """"iphone"""" should link to, given that it can refer to both the product being released by Apple and the current  Linksys VoIP-based phone by Cisco. Some of the points made include: 
 *Majority of those looking for information on """"iphone"""" are most likely looking for that pertaining to Apple's product. Wikipedia's policy for naming articles as they are """"most easily recognized"""" might support """"iphone"""" jumping directly to Apple's iphone. 
 *Cisco owns the trademark for """"iphone"""", used to describe a product that predates Apple's. Some argue the link should therefore reference that page. 

  
 ;Comments 

 I came to this page from the  RfC page and, although somewhat interested in Apple's iphone, am removed from this naming issue. From the article standpoint, I'd suggest: 
 *While Wikipedia's  naming conventions do recommend articles be named as they'd most commonly be recognized, I see this as describing individual articles, and not implying that the better known of two articles should be given priority over use of a particular name. Instead the policy suggests to """"use the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things"""" and another guideline encourages choosing names to avoid ambiguous cases Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)). 
 *At the same time, guidelines suggest that a """"moral right"""", including legal rights, should not govern article names, so it would not seem correct for iphone to link directly to Cisco's product on the basis of it owning the trademark. (See Wikipedia:Naming_conflict). 
 *At least one user in the talk section reported arriving at this page looking for the Linksys phone, so it seems safe to assume that even if the Apple iphone were the more popular article, that ambiguity still exists. And while most people who type mac may be looking for Apple's computer, this still leads to a disambiguation page. 

 Altogether, to me it would seem most neutral and consistent with Wikipedia to rename this article iphone (Apple) and have iphone link to a disambiguation page.  """

It's going to be big, so I'm not sure at this stage how much description there will be.  It's taking a lot of time; at present I am in the 900s of a database of nearly 3,000 (better than Pastscape with over 6,000 for Cheshire). Yes, keys are necessary; I'll probably not bother with the HER numbers but, as a reference document, I think the SM numbers should be there.  I've started including a reference to the Revealing Cheshire's Past site for the latest entries - you might like to have a peep at one of them to see the sort of info it includes.

I snapped when I saw him posting bullshit from Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Hypocrisy defined. Personally, I think his all-consuming hatred for Microsoft is pretty scary. Any rational person would realize that such obsession not only accomplishes little, but also only makes you more a victim of your (real or imagined) enemy. Will he ever actually hurt the beast that is Bill Gates and co? No. But he can let his anger burn him up along with a lot of other hard working editors here, and, perhaps, in his mind, that validates his paranoid delusions of victimization allowing him to blame a faceless entity for the fact that he's wasting so much of his life on this petty crap. Bah. Whatever. We can only hope he'll run out of steam eventually. Luckily for you, he doesn't seem to be a criminal genius, if you catch my meaning, so at least his weak, if persistent, attacks can be overturned.

 :::That's an interesting comment. But if my reading is correct, WP:FAUNA doesn't say to use an obscure Latin binominal whenever there are multiple common names. As long as we pick a name that is both sufficiently unambiguous and more common than """"Sistrurus catenatus"""", I think it would be an improvement over the current title. The examples in WP:FAUNA seem to concern only whether a candidate common name is sufficiently unambiguous or sufficiently common. In the list above, the candidate names other than """"Massasauga"""" generally seem either ambiguous (a """"Gray rattlesnake"""" or """"Spotted rattler"""" could fit many species) or insufficiently common. For ambiguous names, we need to ignore the hit counts because they include many off-topic results. Some of those names are simply more specific (e.g., obviously, """"Prairie Massasauga"""" and """"Swamp Massasauga"""" are simply more specific topics) or redundant (e.g., """"Massasauga rattlesnake"""" and """"Massasauga rattler""""). I didn't know about the park – that could generate some false hits, but not very many. I think the park is not a major topic, and may be named after the snake (which is one of the species that the article says is found there). With a Google advanced search that excludes all results that include the word """"park"""", there are still 177,000 hits for """"massasauga"""". —  """

 There is a Wikia website called: Doblaje.wikia.com (Doblaje is Dubbing in Spanish) where it shows all foreign media dubbed in Latin Spanish (Mexico, Colombia, Los Angles, Miami, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador and Pureto Rico use Latin Spanish). They show information for Latin Spanish dubbed Movies, Cartoons, TV shows, Anime, Videogames, Tokusatsu, Animated films, Anime films, and more.

34306e01f976fb94,"""Hi Garamond, 

 No problem with the delay; I had to sleep! 

 It might take me a while to dig out references, and to make matters worse, I doubt that the references would use the identical terms that I did. However, let's explain some of my intentions in replying to your perfectly reasonable questions. 
 #I've never heard of chemical reactions being described as """"consistent"""" or """"non-random""""... Here you take me aback; firstly, I have a personal niggle with the frequently incorrect use of the term """"random"""" to mean little more than varied or unpredictable. In this respect I have sinned somewhat myself in that quoted text. I trust that something like my precise intention will emerge from my circumscription. I am not sure whether your objection is that your various colleagues and contacts disagreed with my intended meaning, or whether they simply would have used different terms. Nor would I argue if someone were to propose different terms. As far as the intended sense is concerned, consider in particular reactions that, in the absence of constraint, incline to inconsistent chirality or branching. I am sure that your colleagues would not expect to get consistent production of L-amino acids, or purely straight-chain fatty acids by passing sparks through a notionally primitive atmosphere, or by the application of charring heat. Conversely, in attempting to produce similar compounds by appropriate application of enzymes and other appropriate catalysts to suitable precursors, I am sure that they would expect thoroughly consistent chirality and straight chains. I am slightly nonplussed by your use of the expression """"the inconsistency and randomness"""" of these reactions. I am certain that you have other concepts in mind than those that I did. 
 #Specificity, as I used the term, refers to a reaction that works on a particular combination of precursors, and produces equally definite combinations, or a single product. Very commonly the term and the concept go together with selectivity, meaning that if the reaction is applied to a mix, it will work on only certain compounds in the mix. Here again, such specificity and selectivity are exactly what one expects in large classes of enzymatic reactions, and sees on a large scale in every metabolic chart. It most certainly is not the kind of thing one expects to see in a spark-driven reaction chamber, particularly in the absence of catalysts, right? 
 #You say: """"It's my understanding that enzymes operate randomly, inconsistently, and non-specifically."""" Errr...???? Certainly there are necessarily """"random"""" aspects to any reaction in which molecules, ions and even atoms interact unconstrained, but these are not attributes that I would have looked for in enzymatic reactions. I expect enzymes to catalyse reactions and interactions in such a manner as to produce predictable chirality and predictable products (within certain limits; one does not expect quite the same results from applying say chymotrypsin to a protein suspension as when one applies trypsin, but within reasonable context, and ignoring details of which of a number of similar bonds will be cleaved first, one can be pretty confident don't you think?) I think it would help if you could elaborate on your understanding. 
 #You ask: """"Is """"chemically and stereochemically"""" a distinction with a difference?"""" In my circles certainly! If I produce tartaric acid by oxidising fumaric acid with permanganate, I expect a racemic mix, whereas a suitably chosen enzyme system will give me a chiral product. Both reactions are reasonably chemically specific (the enzymatic reaction probably more so) but the simpleminded oxidation is not at all stereochemically specific, whereas the enzymatic reaction is highly stereochemically specific in the product it yields. Conversely, given a racemic mix of tartaric acids, I would have great difficulty using inorganic reagents to alter one chirality rather than the other. Most such reagents are not stereochemically selective, even if they are chemically selective. Enzymes on the other hand are commonly highly stereochemically as well as chemically selective. Are we at cross purposes in some way? 

 :It is of course possible that you use other terms in this connection, and if you do so I certainly have no quarrel but I am quite taken aback by our apparent mutual misunderstanding. I had thought that the terms I had used were pretty basic, so I would be grateful if we could continue this discussion until the confusion is sorted out. 

 :Note that in the field of abiogenesis in the sense of this article, a common factor in many of the mineral-mediated proposals involves substances with particular distributions of charges in particular configurations on crystal surfaces and the like. This, you will recognise is no novelty in the field of catalysis, and in recent decades it has grown to greater prominence in industrial chemistry. In part"

 Further, I did not decide to write an article for Wahlsten or Dweck, I have written one for Peter Schonemann. Whether Dweck or Wahlsten have Wikipedia pages is not any of my concern. Peter Schonemann is a very notable scholar, especially where technical expertise is relevant (this is indisputable) and this is the reason why I have written the article. 

 Personally, I believe you are more impressed by the novelty of a scholar than the quality – Coincidentally, Dr. Phil has a following of millions, should this also qualify him as a seriously scholar?

Presumably, you do not mean what you say literally, as suggested by your argument that """"the main evidence for the claim is the absence of positive reviews in scholarly journals"""". So, I suggest that at the very least you use a more literal turn of phrase. For example, """"reviews in scholarly journals have mostly been negative"""", or """"a number of prominent [less POV than """"leading""""] historians have written largely negative reviews"""".

Your attempts to impugn my intellectual integrity notwithstanding, the fact that you first posted here after the controversy started, the way you describe conservatives and conservative sources, your obvious agenda that perfectly aligns with the agenda of only one side of the controversy, your ironic admission that you've been involved in a wide variety of political articles (me? zero), and your readily apparent and repeated dismissal of an entire spectrum of thought here leaves no doubt whatsoever about your extreme bias."

 ::Completely unrelated to this, I've nicked two templates from the Finnish Wikipedia: Template:Hiero and Template:Hiero/pharaoh. The first presents a unified system for displaying hieroglyphs on article pages (particularly for names of deities). The second provides two cartouches for the praenomina and nomina of pharaohs. The variables are straightforward: variable 1 is the name in 'said' transliteration, variable 2 is the praenomen/name in hieroglyphs (you have to include the tags still), and variable 3 (for the pharaoh template) is the nomen in hieroglyphs. I've changed the order of pharaoh's names from the Finnish system: it seemed to make more sense to have the praenomen first."
